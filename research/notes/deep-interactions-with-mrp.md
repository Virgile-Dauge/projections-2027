summary: 'Ghitza & Gelman (2013, AJPS, doi:10.1111/AJPS.12004, 181 citations), the
  canonical ''deep MRP'' paper. Extends standard MRP to deeply-interacted cells (income
  x ethnicity x state, plus two- and three-way interactions with weakly-informative
  varying-effect priors) to estimate turnout and vote choice for very small demographic-geographic
  subgroups from 2004/2008 US presidential survey data. Improves on prior MRP (Park/Gelman/Bafumi
  2004; Lax/Phillips 2009) via: deeper covariate interaction, non-linear/non-monotonic
  covariate relationships, survey-weight handling, post-estimation turnout/vote-level
  adjustment, and multidimensional graphical model-checking. Crucially, all validation
  in this paper is at the STATE level or coarser demographic cells within states --
  it does not test accuracy below the state/district level, and does not report rank-correlation
  or ordinal accuracy metrics against precinct-level ground truth. It is the load-bearing
  citation behind ''sophistication helps at fine grain'' claims, but the paper itself
  only demonstrates finer DEMOGRAPHIC granularity, not finer GEOGRAPHIC granularity
  below electoral districts.'

Deep Interactions with MRP∗
Election Turnout and Voting Patterns Among Small Electoral Subgroups

Abstract
Using multilevel regression and poststratiﬁcation (MRP), we estimate voter turnout and vote choice
within deeply interacted subgroups: subsets of the population that are deﬁned by multiple demographic
and geographic characteristics. This article lays out the models and statistical procedures we use, along
with the steps required to ﬁt the model for the 2004 and 2008 Presidential elections. Though MRP is
an increasingly popular method, we improve upon it in numerous ways: deeper levels of covariate inter-
action, allowing for non-linearity and non-monotonicity, accounting for unequal inclusion probabilities
that are conveyed in survey weights, post-estimation adjustments to turnout and voting levels, and in-
formative multidimensional graphical displays as a form of model checking. We use a series of examples
to demonstrate the ﬂexibility of our method, including an illustration of turnout and vote choice as sub-
groups become increasingly detailed, and an analysis of both vote choice changes and turnout changes
from 2004 to 2008.

The introduction of survey methods into the social sciences in the 1940s preceded an explosion of scholarly
work explaining the voting behavior of the American public. This work has touched various behavioral topics:
political participation (Downs, 1957; Wolﬁnger and Rosenstone, 1980; Rosenstone and Hansen, 1993; Verba,
Schlozman and Brady, 1995; McDonald and Popkin, 2002; Putnam, 2001; Skocpol, 2004; Gerber and Green,
2000), public opinion formation (Converse, 1964; Achen, 1975; Zaller, 1992; Carmines and Stimson, 1989;
Page and Shapiro, 1992), determinants of vote choice (Berelson, Lazarsfeld and McPhee, 1954; Campbell
et al., 1964; Key, 1966; Fiorina, 1981; Fiorina and Abrams, 2009), and the impact of party identiﬁcation
(Wattenberg, 1986; Bartels, 2000; Erikson, MacKuen and Stimson, 2002; Green, Palmquist and Schickler,
2004), to name a few.
This paper presents a set of tools to study these topics and others in greater geographic and demographic
detail than has been previously possible. Moving beyond traditional regression and crosstab-based inferences,
we use multilevel regression and poststratiﬁcation (MRP) to derive precise vote choice and turnout estimates
for small subgroups of the population. Lax and Phillips (2009a,b) discuss the beneﬁts of MRP in statistical
and substantive terms in the context of state-to-state variation in opinion and policies on gay rights. Following
Gelman and Little (1997) and Park, Gelman and Bafumi (2004), Lax and Phillips estimated public opinion
in small subsets of the population but used these only as intermediate quantities to be summed (in the
poststratiﬁcation step) to get averages for each state.
We improve upon this process by deriving estimates for demographic categories within states. As a simple
example, imagine we want to break the population into 5 income categories, 4 ethnic groups (non-Hispanic
white, black, Hispanic, other), and 51 states (including the District of Columbia), and we are interested
in estimating the rate of turnout and average vote (Democrat vs. Republican) within each cell. Even this
simple example totals 5 × 4 × 51 = 1020 cells, making the task nontrivial. If we can break the population
into mutually exclusive categories, however, we are provided the ﬂexibility of combining them arbitrarily, for
example averaging all Hispanic voters together, or all voters in Delaware, or all black low-income voters in
Georgia (this would be a single cell). As we add demographic levels to the analysis, estimating cell values
becomes more diﬃcult.
This work is in the forefront of statistical analysis of survey data. Methodologically, we improve upon
the existing MRP literature in ﬁve ways: (1) modeling deeper levels of interaction between geographic
and demographic covariates, (2) allowing for the relationship between covariates to be nonlinear and even
non-monotonic, if demanded by the data, (3) accounting for survey weights while maintaining appropriate
cell sizes for partial pooling, (4) adjusting turnout and voting levels after estimates are obtained, and
(5) introducing a series of informative multidimensional graphical displays as a form of model checking.
Substantively, we improve upon the work of Gelman et al. (2007)—who studied variation among states
and regions in the relation of income and voting—by moving from two explanatory factors to four, and by
modeling turnout and vote choice in an integrated framework.
To demonstrate the ﬂexibility of our method, we will present several examples of analyses that we
conducted shortly after the 2008 election.
Our goal is not to estimate a single regression coeﬃcient or
identify a single eﬀect, as is often the case in social science. Rather our goal is to paint a broader portrait
of the distribution of the electorate. The graphs that we construct along the way clarify our intuitions and
help us understand the subgroup-level characteristics of both turnout and vote choice.
Through most of the paper, we focus on description and model checking instead of deep causal questions.
Given the uncertainties surrounding demographic voting trends and their interaction with state-to-state
variation, we feel it is an important contribution to simply put together this information and measure these

trends, setting up a ﬁrm foundation for future researchers to study fundamental political questions using the
best possible survey-based estimates. As such, this work ﬁts with recent literature that devotes considerable
eﬀort to deriving better estimates which can be fed into later analyses1.
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section lays out our statistical methods in detail, describing our
methods all the way from statistical notation through computational implementation details and graphical
model checking. After describing our data sources, we then go through a series of examples, all of which were
conducted after the 2008 election as we were analyzing voting and turnout trends over recent Presidential
elections. In tandem, the examples illustrate our ability to construct stable and reasonable estimates even
for detailed subgroups. We conclude with discussion.
Statistical methods
Notation
We develop the notation in the context of a general three-way structure:
The population is deﬁned based on three variables, taking on levels j1 = 1, . . . , J1; j2 = 1, . . . , J2; j3 =
1, . . . , J3. For example, in our model of income × ethnicity × state, J = (5, 4, 51). Any individual cell in
this model can be written as j = (j1, j2, j3). We index the three factors as k = 1, 2, 3.
We further suppose that each of the three factors k has Lk group-level predictors and is thus associated
with a Jk ×Lk matrix Xk of group-level predictors. The predictors in our example are as follows: For income
(k = 1), we have a 5 × 2 matrix X1 whose two columns correspond to a constant term and a simple index
variable that takes on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For ethnicity (k = 2), we only have a constant term, so X2 is a
4 × 1 matrix of ones. For state (k = 3), we have three predictors in the vote choice model: a constant term,
Republican vote share in a past presidential election, and average income in the state (we also will use the
classiﬁcation of states into regions, but we will get back to this later). Thus, X3 is a 51 × 3 matrix.
Finally, each of our models has a binary outcome, which could be the decision of whether to vote or for
which candidate to vote. In any case, we label the outcome as y and, within any cell j, we label yj as the
number of Yes responses in that cell and nj as the number of Yes or No responses (excluding no-answers
and other responses). Assuming independent sampling, the data model is yj ∼Binomial (nj, θj), where θj
is what we want to estimate: the proportion of Yes responses in cell j in the population.
Poststatiﬁcation
For some purposes we are interested in displaying the estimated θj’s directly, for example when mapping
voter turnout or vote intention by state, with separate maps for each age and income category (see Figure 4).
Other times we want to aggregate across categories, for example summing over race to estimate votes by
income and state (Figure 2) or averaging nationally or over regions to focus on demographic breakdowns.
In the latter cases we poststratify—that is, average over groups in proportion to their size in the pop-
ulation. We might be averaging over the voting-age population, or the voting-eligible population, or the
population of voters, or even a subset such as the people who voted for John McCain for president. In any
1Examples include better measures of roll call data (Clinton, Jackman and Rivers, 2004; Carroll et al., 2009), district-level
preferences (Levendusky, Pope and Jackman, 2008; Kernell, 2009), voter knowledge (Ansolabehere, Rodden and Snyder,
2008), the ideological connection between voters, legislators, and candidates (Bafumi and Herron, 2010; Ansolabehere and
Jones, 2010; Jessee, 2009) and many others.

case, label Nj as the relevant population in cell j, and suppose we are interested in θS: the average of θj’s
within some set JS of cells. The poststratiﬁed estimate is simply
θS =
X
j∈JS
Njθj /
X
j∈JS
Nj.
(1)
For example, to prepare the state × ethnicity estimates in Figure 3, we aggregated the 5 × 4 × 51 cells j
into 4 × 51 sets JS, with each poststratiﬁcation (1) having four terms in the numerator and four in the
denominator.
When the Nj’s are known, or are treated as known (as in the case of the voting-age population; see
the “Data sources” section), poststratiﬁcation is easy. When the Nj’s are merely estimated, we continue to
apply (1), this time plugging in estimates of the Nj’s obtained from some preliminary analysis. This should
be reasonable in our application, although in more complex settings, a fully Bayesian approach might be
preferred in order to better propagate the uncertainty in the estimated group sizes (Schutt, 2009). For the
remainder of this article, we shall treat the Nj’s as known.
Setting up multilevel regression
We ﬁt a model that includes group-level predictors as well as unexplained variation at each of the levels of
the factors and their interactions. This resulting non-nested (crossed) multilevel is complicated enough that
we build it up in stages.
Classical logistic regression: To start, we ﬁt a simple (non-multilevel) model on the J cells, with cell-
level predictors derived from the group-level predictor matrices X1, X2, X3.
For each cell j (labeled
with three indexes as j = (j1, j2, j3)) we start with the main eﬀects, which comes to a constant term
plus (L1 −1) + (L2 −1) + (L3 −1) predictors (with the −1 terms coming from the duplicates of the
constant term from the three design matrices). We then include all the two-way interactions, which give
(L1−1)(L2−1)+(L1−1)(L3−1)+(L2−1)(L3−1) additional predictors. In our example, these correspond to
diﬀerent slopes for income among Republican and Democratic states, and diﬀerent slopes for income among
rich and poor states. The classical regression is formed by the binomial data model along with a logistic
link, θj = logit−1 (Xjβ), where X is the combined predictor matrix constructed above.
Multilevel regression with no group-level predictors: If we ignore the group-level predictors, we can form
a basic multilevel logistic regression by modeling the outcome for cells j by factors for the components,
j1, j2, j3:
θj = logit−1 
α0 + α1
j1 + α2
j2 + α3
j3 + α1,2
j1,j2 + α1,3
j1,j3 + α2,3
j2,j3 + α1,2,3
j1,j2,j3

,
(2)
where each batch of coeﬃcients has its own scale parameter: for any subset S of {1, 2, 3}, αS is an array
with
Y
s∈S
Js elements, which we give independent prior distributions αS
j ∼N
 0, (σS)2
. We complete the
model with a prior distribution for the group-level variance parameters: (σS)2 ∼inv-χ2  ν, σ2
0

, with these
last two parameters given weak priors and estimated from data. Because the binomial distribution has an
internally speciﬁed variance, it is possible to estimate all the variance components, up to and including the
three-way interactions.

We can also write (2) in more general notation by summing over subsets S of {1, 2, 3}:
θj = logit−1
 X
S
αS
S(j)
!
,
(3)
where S(j) represents the indexes of j corresponding to the elements of S. In our running example, the subset
S = {1, 3} represents income × state interactions, and for this set of terms in the regression, S(j) = (j1, j3)
indexes the income category and state corresponding to cell j. The terms in the summation within (3)
correspond to the eight terms in (2).
Multilevel model with group-level predictors: The next step is to combine the above two models by taking
the classical regression and adding the multilevel terms; this is a varying-intercept regression (also called a
mixed-eﬀects model):
θj = logit−1
 
Xjβ +
X
S
αS
S(j)
!
,
(4)
with a uniform prior distribution on the vector beta of “ﬁxed eﬀects” and a hierarchical Gaussian prior
distribution for the batches of “random eﬀects” α, as before.
Multilevel model with varying slopes for group-level predictors: The importance of particular demographic
factors can vary systematically by state. For example, individual income is more strongly associated with
Republican voting in rich states than in poor states. Gelman et al. (2007) ﬁt this pattern using a varying-
intercept, varying-slope multilevel logistic regression. Our model is more complicated than theirs, but the
same principle applies: we will ﬁt the data better by allowing regression slopes–not just intercepts–to vary
by group.
We implement by allowing each coeﬃcient to vary by all the factors not included in the predictors. In our
example, the coeﬃcients for the state-level predictors (Republican presidential vote share and average state
income) are allowed to vary by income level and ethnicity, while the coeﬃcient for the continuous income
predictor can vary by ethnicity and state. The general form of the model combines (2) and (3) by allowing
each batch of coeﬃcients in (3) to vary by group as in (2). To write this more general form requires another
stage of notation in which the coeﬃcients for any set of group-level predictors can be labeled βS, and whose
components come from a distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation σS. This is analogous to the
varying intercepts which are labeled αS, as before.
Adding a multilevel model for one of the group-level factors: The ﬁnal model includes classical logistic
regression as a baseline to shrink to, and then these model’s coeﬃcients vary by group (in our example,
varying by ethnic group, income category, and state).
Adding region as an additional predictor: We are already using state as one of the groups in the model,
but we can add region as an additional predictor to capture eﬀects that can be found for large areas of the
country but perhaps do not have enough data to be captured by the state-level groups that are already in
the model. We do this by expanding S from the set of subsets of {1, 2, 3} to the set of subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4},
where α4 will now refer to the region-level varying intercept, and including all relevant interaction terms.
Because region is created as a direct mapping of state, there are no interactions between state and region
(these interactions would be nonsensical and would add no additional information to the model). The ﬁnal
model, then, is:

θj = logit−1

,
(5)
where S is the set of subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4}, referring to income, ethnicity, state, and region, βS
S(j) are varying
slopes for group-level predictors, and αS
S(j) are varying intercepts.
Accounting for survey weights
Many of our survey data come with weights. When ﬁtting regressions to such data, it is not always necessary
to include the weights. Simple unweighted regression is ﬁne—as long as all the variables used in the weighting
are included as regression predictors. The population information encoded in the survey weights enters into
the analysis through the poststratiﬁcation step (see Gelman (2007), for example).
Here, however, we are modeling based on only three factors (ethnicity, income, and state), but the survey
adjustments use several other variables, including sex, age, and education.
Ultimately we want to ﬁt a
complex model including all these predictors, but for now we must accept that our regression does not include
all the weighting variables. Thus our model must account for variation of weights within poststratiﬁcation
cells.
Within each cell j, we make two corrections.
First, we replace the raw data estimate with ¯y∗
j , the
weighted average of the outcome measure, y, within the cell. Second, we adjust the eﬀective sample size for
the measurement to account for the increased variance of a weighted average compared to a simple average,
using the correction:
design.eﬀectj = 1 +

sd(unit weights within cell j)
mean(unit weights within cell j)
2
(6)
These estimated design eﬀects are noisy, and for any given analysis we average them to get a single design
eﬀect for all the cells.
Putting these together, we account for weighting by using the data model y∗
j ∼Binomial
 n∗
j, θj

, where
n∗
j =
nj
design.eﬀect, and y∗
j = ¯y∗
j nj. The resulting n∗
j, y∗
j will not in general be integers, but we handle this by
simply using the binomial likelihood function with non-integer data, which works ﬁne in practice (and is in
fact simply the weighted log-likelihood approach to ﬁtting generalized linear models with weighted data).
This falls in the category of quasi-likelihood methods (Wedderburn, 1974).
Computation
We ultimately would like to perform fully Bayesian inference for our models, but for now, we have been using
the approximate marginal maximum likelihood estimates obtained using the glmer() program in R (Bates
and Maechler, 2009). Such estimates are sometimes justiﬁed on their own theoretical and computational
grounds (e.g., Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, 2004), but here we are considering them as approximations to
fully-Bayesian inference. Recent work on multilevel modeling and poststratiﬁcation gives us conﬁdence that
this approach works well in estimating demographic and state-by-state breakdowns from national surveys
(Lax and Phillips, 2009a,b).
For our running example, the lmer() model looks like this:

where the vectors here have length J = J1J2J3 and, for each element j: y is a 2-column matrix indicating
the number of Democratic and Republican voters in cell j (adjusted for varying survey weights). Table 1
describes each of the variables in the computational model and lists the analogous term from the statistical
model. inc, eth, and stt are index vectors running from 1–5, 1–4, and 1–51 indexing the grouping factors
in the model; reg indicates the region of the country, which is mapped directly from stt; z.incstt and
z.repprv are state-level predictors of income and previous Republican vote that have been centered and
rescaled (hence the “z”) and have been expanded to length J by repeating over the index stt; z.inc is
the 1–5 inc index after it has been centered and rescaled (thus including it as a linear predictor as well
as non-monotonically); and reg.eth, reg.inc, stt.eth, stt.inc, and eth.inc are the interaction terms.
Notice that z.incstt and z.repprv are considered part of β3 and β4 because they are included only as
group-level predictors for these variables. In contrast, z.inc is both a group-level predictor (for the income
cells) and a varying slope (for the other cells), so it is included in all of the βs.
Our model includes income as a continuous variable (through the z.inc term) and also as a categorical
factor (through the inc terms). Including both in the same model allows a nonlinear ﬁt that partially pools
toward linearity, thus given both the ﬂexibility of the categorical ﬁt and the statistical eﬃciency of including
a linear term for an approximately linear predictor (see section 12.6 of Gelman and Hill (2007)).”
In future versions of the model, we can also include a term of the form, (1 | inc.eth.stt) to allow
saturated interactions. In the meantime, we estimate the residual cell-level variance and compare it to the
(design-eﬀect-adjusted) binomial variance. If the residual variance is much higher than would be expected
from the sampling model, this implies that three-way interactions should be included. In the models ﬁt for
the present article, this was not the case. We have developed a freely available R package called mrp, which
implements all of these steps including the ability to ﬁt the model with fully saturated interactions.

Figure 1: The evolution of a simple model of vote choice in the 2008 election for state × income subgroups,
non-Hispanic whites only. The colors come from the 2008 election, with darker shades of red and blue for
states that had larger margins in favor of McCain or Obama, respectively. The ﬁrst panel shows the raw data;
the middle panel is a hierarchical model where state coeﬃcients vary but the (linear) income coeﬃcient is
held constant across states; the right panel allows the income coeﬃcient to vary by state. Adding complexity
to the model reveals weaknesses in inferences drawn from simpler versions of the model. Three states—MS,
OH, and CT—are highlighted to show important trends.
Graphical display of inferences and model checking
When social scientists present data, they tend to use tables instead of graphs, despite the ability of graphs
to translate large amounts of data in clearer and less obtrusive ways (Kastellec and Leoni, 2007). This is
especially true when it comes to the presentation of regression estimates. Dozens of numbers with too many
digits are squeezed into a tiny space, the reader drawn to the stars showing signiﬁcant eﬀects. Substantive
eﬀect size is generally interpretable for single coeﬃcients, but what about interactions? Two-way interactions
can sometimes be understood but are rarely teased out in any detail, and interpretability of three- and four-
way interactions is virtually impossible.
We take the opposite approach in this paper and in our research in general, viewing graphical data
visualization as a key step in understanding model ﬁt and building conﬁdence in our inferences. Our approach
is to build a full model in stages: build a simple version of the model; graph results to check ﬁt; make the
model more complex; graph results to see if and how the model ﬁt changes; continue until reaching the ﬁnal
model. An example of this is Figure 1, which shows the evolution of a simple model of vote choice in the 2008
election for state × income subgroups. This is a parallel coordinates plot: estimates are for non-Hispanic
whites only, with color indicating each state’s overall vote. The ﬁrst panel shows the raw data; the second
panel is a simple model where state coeﬃcients are allowed to vary but the (linear) income coeﬃcient is held
constant across states; the last panel allows the income coeﬃcient to vary by state. Three states—MS, OH,
and CT—are highlighted to show important trends.
These simple models and visualizations reveal quite a bit about the data. In the ﬁrst panel we can see
that raw estimates are noisy and insuﬃcient to reveal any clear structure, despite a sample size exceeding
15,000. The second panel indicates high state-level variance and is suggestive that higher income is tied to

higher McCain vote. The third panel shows that this simple story is insuﬃcient: there is a wide variance
in the income coeﬃcient, with richer voters supporting McCain in red states but supporting Obama in blue
states. This distinction is theoretically similar to (and more extreme than) the relationship between income
and voting found in Gelman et al. (2008).
We prefer the graphical strategy in general, but even more so in the present project due to the implausi-
bility of checking each parameter estimate for each of our models and the futility in trying to do so, as deep
interactions would be uninterpretable in this setting. Instead of trying to interpret regression coeﬃcients one
at a time or in conjunction, examining ﬁtted subgroup estimates facilitates a more natural interpretation
of the model. In other words, it is easier to notice when subgroup estimates seem right, while regression
coeﬃcients are more diﬃcult to assess. For example, when we started this analysis, we knew a priori that our
estimates for Obama’s vote share among African American groups needed to be high, over 90%, but we could
not know what regression coeﬃcient was plausible, as the coeﬃcient could change drastically depending on
functional form.
Another example of the power of graphical model checking is shown in Figure 2.
While iteratively
building our model, it became clear that there were problems in our estimates, especially as they related to
ethnicity2. These graphs represent a better way of looking at the data as a whole—they indicate McCain’s
share of the two-party vote in each income/state cell, estimated for all voters (in gray) and non-Hispanic
whites (in orange). While some states have similar orange and grey trend lines, they diverge tremendously
in some cases. Any method for ﬁtting an elaborate model should come with procedures for evaluating it
and building conﬁdence. The state-by-state plots in Figure 2 are, we believe, a good start on the way to the
general goal of tracing the mapping from data to inference.
Data sources
For estimates of cell population size, we use the 5% public use micro sample (PUMS) of the long form
Census for 2000, which has a sample of size 9,827,156 among voting-age citizens. When broken down into
subgroups, this yields, for instance, a weighted estimate of 4,596 white women in Kentucky aged 45–64
with college educations and incomes over $100,000, or 156 black men in North Carolina aged 30–44 with
postgraduate degrees and incomes under $20,000. Because of the large sample size of the PUMS data and
the fact that population size estimates are not our primary quantities of interest, we treat these PUMS
numbers as truth. For 2004 and 2008, we use the American Community Survey (ACS), a large national
sample that gives much of the same information as the long-form Census (enough information to construct
the same subgroups in each of the years). We use the 2004 ACS (N=850,924 for voting-age citizens) for
our 2004 estimates, and we use the pooled 2005-2007 ACS (N=6,291,316 for the same group) for our 2008
estimates. Again, for now we take the weighted ACS values as exact numbers of the voting-age population
in each subcategory3.
To construct turnout estimates, we use the Current Population Survey’s post-election Voting and Regis-
tration supplement, conducted every two years in November and generally considered to be the gold standard
2We posted maps on the internet, and politically-savvy readers noted problems in some of the state/income categories which
could be traced back to interactions between ethnicity, income, and state that had not been included in the earlier versions of
our model.
3If we reach the stage of being interested in extremely small groups of the population, we can ﬁt an overdispersed Poisson model
to capture sampling variability in the context of weighted survey data: in each cell j, let nj be the number of CPS respondents
in the cell and wj be the average survey weight of the respondents in the cell. The model is nj ∼overdispersed-Poisson(θj/wj),
where θj is the actual voting-age population in the cell. The simple estimate of θj is proportional to wjnj, but with sparse
data a model could be helpful.

on voter turnout, especially when it comes to estimating turnout for demographic subgroups. The survey
does not ask people how they voted, but it asks whether they voted. We can compare the survey results,
nationally and at the state level, with actual number of votes. We use Michael McDonald’s “highest oﬃce”
vote totals4. The CPS comes close to these numbers. For example, 131,304,731 people voted for president in
2008, representing an estimated 57% of the voting-age population and 62% of the voting-eligible population.
The CPS turnout estimate is 68% for voting-age citizens. This estimate is higher than McDonald’s estimates,
most likely due to vote over-reporting bias, but the CPS generally has less over-reporting bias than other
surveys like the American National Election Studies.
For each election we use the CPS to estimate the probability that a voting-age citizen will turn out to
vote, given his or her demographics and state of residence (N=68,643, 79,148, 74,327 in 2000, 2004, 2008
after removing missing data). We know the actual number of voters for each state and perform a simple
adjustment so that overall turnout matches the state totals, as follows. Let ξs indicate the number of voters
for each state s = 1, . . . , 51 and let S denote the set of cells such that j is in state s. We derive the adjusted
turnout estimate θ∗
j for each cell j ∈S as follows:
δs = min
 
abs
 
ξs −
X
S
 Nj logit−1 (logit (θj) + δ)

!!
(7)
θ∗
j = θj + δs ∀j ∈S,
(8)
where abs() is the absolute value function and min() is a function that ﬁnds the δ that minimizes the
expression. This process simply applies a constant logistic adjustment δs to each cell in state s to make sure
that the total number of estimated voters is correct. We assume here that over-reporting bias is consistent
across cells within state. Because the CPS data has a vote overreport bias, δs is usually negative.
We are interested in diﬀerences in turnout rate by demographic group, so it is important to consider
whether overreport bias is consistent across demographic groups. In the 1980s, scholars investigated demo-
graphic correlates of overreporting in the American National Election Studies (ANES). Though evidence is
mixed, overall there were no consistently strong relationships between demographics and overreporting, with
the exception of African Americans slightly overreporting more than Whites (Katosh and Traugott, 1981;
Sigelman, 1982; Abramson and Claggett, 1984; Silver, Anderson and Abramson, 1986). Bernstein, Chadha
and Montjoy (2001) revisited the data, arguing that overreporting is more likely among people who are under
the most social pressure to vote, such as educated people, partisans, and minorities in minority districts,
but Cassel (2003) showed that these ﬁndings are model-speciﬁc and the eﬀect is generally small in typical
model speciﬁcations. In terms of the CPS data used in this study, McDonald (2007) recently showed that
demographic descriptions of the electorate are approximately the same when using the CPS data and voter
registration ﬁles, in contrast to using exit polls which show a younger electorate with more minorities. In
many ways, then, the CPS data is the “gold standard” of survey data on voter turnout.
To construct vote choice estimates, we use the National Annenberg Election Survey in 2000 and 2004
and Pew Research pre-election polls (N=31,719, 43,970, 19,170 in 2000, 2004, 2008 after removing missing
data). These surveys get large samples by aggregating rolling cross-sections and waves conducted over several
months. The model is of the same form, and we do a similar adjustment for vote choice as in equations (6)
and (7) above, substituting the estimated number of voters θ∗
j Nj instead of population size Nj. Because
vote choice does not suﬀer over-reporting bias, δs is usually smaller in magnitude here.

Figure 3: Turnout/vote choice distribution in the 2008 presidential election. Each bubble represents one
demographic subgroup per state, with size and color indicating population size and ethnicity. As additional
demographics are added, heterogeneity within subgroups is revealed by the dispersion of the bubbles, while
estimates remain reasonable.
Putting it all together
Now that our model and graphical approach are fully described, we present examples of the type of analysis
that can be done using this method. We ﬁt numerous models using the framework described above, using
the following covariates: state, region, ethnicity, income, education, and age. Eventually we want to include
additional demographics such as sex, religion, number of children, and others, and we are currently working
on software which will allow model ﬁtting in this higher dimensional space.
Demographic expansion
Figure 3 shows the distribution of geographic/demographic subgroups in the 2008 presidential election. In
each of these graphs, the x- and y-axes show McCain vote and election turnout, respectively. Moving from left
to right, we add additional demographic covariates—state and ethnicity are shown on the left, family income
is added in the middle5, and age is added on the right6. Bubbles are sized proportionally to population, and
colors indicate ethnicity: white=non-Hispanic white, black=African American, red=Hispanic, green=Other,
all drawn with transparency to increase visibility7. By the end of the full demographic expansion, 51 × 4 ×
5 × 4 = 4080 groups are plotted in on the right.
This type of graph helps us conﬁrm top-level trends on race-based voting and turnout, and it builds
conﬁdence in our estimates. The left graph shows that, as expected, African Americans in all states voted
overwhelmingly for Obama. Hispanic voters and other non-whites also voted heavily Democratic, while white
voters are spread out and more likely to vote for McCain. In terms of turnout, Hispanics and Others voted
less as a whole. As we add covariates, the bubbles become increasingly dispersed. Although mainstream
political commentary tends to think of demographic groups (especially minorities) as homogenous voting

citizenship.

blocs, they exhibit substantial heterogeneity. For example, consider African Americans in North Carolina.
In a state that went 50–49 for Obama, they comprised roughly 20% of the population, had 72% turnout
(similar to the state total of 71%) and voted for Obama 95–5. However, looking more closely we can see
that the richest African Americans in North Carolina “only” voted for Obama 86–14 with a turnout of 84%,
while the poorest went 97–3 with 53% turnout. These diﬀerences (11 points in vote choice and 31 points
in turnout) are substantial. As another example, let us compare Hispanics to non-Hispanic whites in New
Mexico, another important swing state. As a whole, Hispanic turnout was much lower (53% compared to
74%), but there was basically no diﬀerence among the richest and most educated (89% to 93%).
The important takeaways here are that (1) there are substantial and important diﬀerences between
subgroups, even within demographic categories, and (2) our method captures those diﬀerences while keeping
estimates stable and reasonable. This is in line with Figure 1: there we showed that raw estimates are too
noisy to be interpretable and that increasingly complicated statistical models help reveal trends in the data.
Here we show the same thing with more variables included.
Homogeneous or Heterogeneous Vote Swing?
One of the important features of the MRP framework is that we can look at the overall distribution of
estimates as well as combine estimates in any way we please. We can, for example, combine estimates to
examine shifts in vote choice for demographic/geographic subgroups. It is well known that states, when
measured in the aggregate, tend to shift uniformly from election to election (Lock and Gelman, 2010). This
can be referred to as a homogenous partisan swing—for example, the change in Republican vote from 1996
to 2000 was 5.6 points and a standard deviation of 3.3 (after removing Washington, DC as an outlier). That
is, after accounting for the national swing towards Bush, most states were within 3–4 points compared to
their relative position in 1996. The standard deviations for the 2000–2004 and 2004–2008 swings (excluding
DC) are 2.4 and 3.8, showing similar stability.
When we break the electorate down by demographics, though, the homogenous swing breaks down. It
is easy to show that there was an enormous diﬀerence between ethnicities—for example, whites had a 3.3%
shift towards Obama and non-whites had a 7.8% shift—but again a single demographic cut hides much of
the variation. Figure 4 displays public opinion change among whites as a series of maps broken down by
age and income. Although almost every state moved towards Obama as a whole, this graph clearly shows
subgroups that resisted the aggregate electoral forces and moved towards McCain, sometimes by substantial
margins. These anti-Obama groups are mostly poorer and older white voters, especially in the South and
Appalachia8.
Turnout Swing
As mentioned, our framework is not just a way to look at state-level estimates, rather it allows us to combine
subgroups in any way we please. For the following example, we move to national trends by examining change
in turnout levels from 2004–2008. Turnout went up as a whole this election, but the upward turnout swing
was not uniform. One of the main storylines of the 2008 campaign, in fact, was Obama’s ability to energize
a new group of voters, especially minorities and young people. Figure 5 evaluates that claim by breaking
the turnout swing out by age, ethnicity, and income. Each plot here actually shows a number of things. The
8Many of these groups also disapproved of Obama’s health care reform agenda in 2009. Looking at this data with the beneﬁt
of hindsight, it seems that the roots of his political problems with this group were planted during the election.

income and age.

histograms show the distribution of age/ethnicity group by income—going from left to right in each plot
shows low to high income—while the trend line shows the turnout change. The aggregate turnout increase
(3.6%) is plotted as the horizontal reference line, with another reference line at 0% change.
The main point that we would like to highlight here is that the turnout swing was primarily driven by
African Americans and young minorities. These group are highlighted in blue with a thick box, because they
are the only groups with a total turnout change over 5%. Although the popular consensus would imply that
young white voters also increased their turnout, that is simply not the case. Poor younger whites indeed
turned out at higher rates than before, but this is a small subset of that overall group, as shown in the
histograms. The incorrect interpretation that has often been given is driven by improperly combining all
young people into a single group. By breaking them out, we see that there is a big diﬀerence between white
young people and minority young people. Of course, our framework allows us to break this out by state
and to show the ﬁnal turnout levels for each subgroup, as shown in Figure 6. Young white turnout is low,
hovering in the 30–40% range for most states9. Hispanic and other ethnicities also remain low in turnout
levels.
Discussion
This paper has introduced and described our method for producing estimates of turnout and vote choice
for deeply interacted subgroups of the population: groups that are deﬁned by multiple demographic and
geographic characteristics. Although regression models have been used for decades to infer these estimates,
MRP is an improvement over traditional methods for several reasons. Multilevel modeling allows estimates
to be partially pooled to take advantage of common characteristics in diﬀerent parts of the electorate, while
poststratiﬁcation corrects for the underlying distribution of the electorate.
Our method improves upon even the most recent implementations of MRP, though, by modeling deeper
levels of interactions and allowing for the relationship between covariates to be nonlinear and even non-
monotonic—in other words, we let the data deﬁne the appropriate level of nonlinearity and interaction
between covariates. Our method also respects the design information included in survey weights, and lastly
it makes aggregate adjustments to make sure our ﬁnal estimates are reasonable. At a substantive level, we
have been able to integrate the study of vote choice and turnout at a level of speciﬁcity that has not been
possible before.
We use MRP to make inferences in the presence of sparse data. Given that our model is necessarily
imperfect, we can interpret our estimates as smoothed versions of the data.
In addition to working on
making the model more realistic (for example, by including nonlinearity and interactions), it makes sense
at each stage to compare the MRP estimates to corresponding raw-data summaries so that we and other
consumers of the analyses can understand the eﬀects of the modeling assumptions on the inferences.
Adding these layers lets the data speak more freely to the ﬁnal estimates, but it imposes challenges in
interpreting the ﬁnal model. As a result, we recommend a gradual and visual approach to model building:
build a simple model, graph inferences, add complexity to that model in the form of additional covariates
and interactions, graph, and continue until all appropriate variables are included. The purpose of intermit-
tent graphing is to ensure that model estimates remain reasonable and that changes induced by additional
covariates or interactions are understood. Because there will eventually be too many interactions to be
interpreted by simply looking at the coeﬃcients, it is important to graph ﬁnal estimates as a substitute or

in addition to the coeﬃcients alone. The model builder with domain-speciﬁc knowledge will more likely ﬁnd
it easier to interpret and understand ﬁnal estimates–for example, among African Americans, 90% support
for Obama is easier to interpret than a coeﬃcient of 2.56, although both may infer the same thing.
We have used the U.S. Presidential elections of 2004 and 2008 to illustrate this process and have found
a number of non-obvious trends, mainly focusing on the 2008 campaign between Barack Obama and John
McCain: (1) although demographic subgroups are often described as monolithic aggregates—especially when
it comes to ethnicity—they are in fact quite diverse when broken down by other characteristics like income
and education.
(2) States as a whole essentially display a “homogeneous swing” between elections, but
demographic subgroups within those states show more variability. (3) The Obama coalition was weakened
by older white low income voters who moved away from him in the election, foreshadowing the diﬃculty
he had convincing this group to support his health care initiatives in 2009 and beyond. (4) Despite media
reports to the contrary, there was not a substantial turnout swing among young white voters; in fact, most
of the increase in turnout came from African Americans and other young minorities. Lastly, (5) despite
modest increases, turnout among young white people and among Hispanics is still low in comparison to
other demographic groups.
Through this paper, our focus has been both introductory and descriptive: introductory because we have
provided inferences for a relatively small number of demographic/geographic combinations, and descriptive
because we have only brieﬂy touched on substantive topics as illustrations, while intentionally avoiding deep
causal questions. Although these methods can certainly be used in conjunction with other tools of causal
inference, the purely observational data are inappropriate for that task. We have also ignored issue opinion
entirely10. Still, given the uncertainties surrounding demographic voting trends and their interaction with
state-to-state variation, we feel these methods can be used to derive better survey estimates and set up a
ﬁrm foundation for future researchers to study fundamental questions using the best possible data.
