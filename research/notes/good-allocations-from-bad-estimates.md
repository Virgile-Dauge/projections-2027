Abstract
Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation is the de facto gold standard for
targeting a treatment to a heterogeneous population. The method estimates treatment effects
up to an error ϵ > 0 in each of M different strata of the population, targeting individuals
in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this
method requires O(M/ϵ2) samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment
effects up to an ϵ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect
as CATE with only O(M/ϵ) samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key
insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we
show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we
evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal
treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples. Our work highlights the fundamental
distinction between treatment effect estimation and treatment allocation: the latter requires far
fewer samples.

Introduction
Different groups in a population—be it schools, counties, or age brackets—often respond dif-
ferently to a treatment [GS85, HR85, IA94, BD09].
This empirical fact has motivated a sig-
nificant body of work on estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE), see, e.g.,
[IR15, AI16, ATW19, KSBY19]. A key application of CATE estimation is in welfare-maximizing
treatment allocation: assigning a limited number of treatments to those groups who benefit most
from treatment. The optimal treatment allocation selects groups in descending order of treatment
effect until the budget runs out. In practice, however, treatment effects first have to be estimated
from data, such as the responses from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the population.
The standard method estimates the treatment effect in each group and allocates in descending
order of estimated treatment effects. Good CATE estimates therefore seem to be the necessary
first step of treatment allocation. Indeed, estimating a single average treatment effect in one group
up to error ϵ > 0 boils down to mean estimation and requires Θ(1/ϵ2) samples. This sample size
requirement holds robustly for almost all problem instances with few exceptions. By extension,
given M non-overlapping groups, CATE estimation requires Θ(M/ϵ2) samples—as does finding

a (1 −ϵ)-optimal treatment allocation. And so it appears that the two problems are essentially
equivalent, at least in the worst-case.
In contrast, we show that for typical instances, we can find a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation with
only O(M/ϵ) samples. Hence, for M = O(1), treatment allocation typically requires quadratically
fewer samples than treatment effect estimation. Whereas estimation has a robust quadratic lower
bound, we show that the quadratic lower bound for allocation is brittle: It’s easy to circumvent in
theory with natural assumptions and it doesn’t arise in any of the real-world datasets we examine.
Our results follow from a simple but powerful win-win situation: If the treatment effect in a group
is well above or well below the optimal cut-off, we can figure that out with very few samples.
Groups close to the threshold, on the other hand, have similar treatment effects. Therefore, we
don’t lose much if we mix them up. The only bad case arises when all units cluster around
the threshold, not too close and not too far. We turn this intuitive observation into a precise
instance-dependent upper bound on the sample complexity of near-optimal treatment allocation.
The formal argument is delicate, since we don’t know the optimal threshold and we can only
work from coarse estimates.
In a nutshell, our theory predicts that near-optimal allocation almost always has a linear—not
quadratic—dependence on 1/ϵ. We thoroughly verify this prediction in five real-world RCT
datasets. In all cases, we can find near-optimal allocations with even fewer samples than our upper
bound suggests. Fundamentally, our work highlights the stark difference between allocation and
estimation: Nearly optimal allocations do not necessarily require highly accurate estimates.
1.1
Our contributions
Consider a partition of the population into M groups and a budget K ∈{1, . . . , M} that allows
treating K out of M groups, such as schools, hospitals, or different age brackets. We refer to
a group as a unit to indicate that for the purpose of treatment allocation we don’t distinguish
between individuals within a unit—we either treat all or none of the individuals within a unit.
We assume that the cost of treating each unit is the same. Our goal is to identify the K units that
would most benefit from receiving a specific treatment. Let τ(u) ∈[0, 1] denote the average effect
of treatment in unit u ∈{1, . . . , M}. A treatment allocation U ⊆[M] is any subset of K = |U|
units. The value achieved by an allocation U is the total sum ∑u∈U τ(u) of treatment effects. An
optimal allocation selects the K units with the highest τ(u) values, breaking ties arbitrarily. We let
V∗denote the value achieved by an optimal allocation.
In this paper, we study the sample complexity of finding a near-optimal allocation. We say that
an allocation is (1 −ϵ)-optimal if it achieves a value V that satisfies V/V∗≥1 −ϵ. For bounded
treatment effects, standard arguments show that we can always find a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation
from O(M/ϵ2) samples. Moreover, there is a problem instance that requires Ω(M/ϵ2) many
samples. While these well-known bounds settle the worst-case sample complexity, our work
shows that the typical sample complexity of treatment allocation is far lower. What matters for our
theoretical results is the shape of the distribution of treatment effects. For all reasonably smooth
distributions—those that don’t put excessive mass on small intervals—we prove that O(M/ϵ)
many samples suffice to get a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation.
Theorem 1 (Informal). If the distribution of treatment effect values τ(u) is “smooth”, we can obtain a
(1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation for any budget K ≤M with O(M/ϵ) many samples.

Figure 1: For the purposes of treatment allocation, we do not require highly-accurate CATE estimates for
groups that have treatment effect values bounded away from the allocation threshold τK.
As illustrated in Figure 1, the key insight behind the theorem is that we only need to estimate
the treatment effect values τ(u) up to accuracy ρ = Θ(√ϵ), rather than ϵ, in order to obtain a
near-optimal allocation. Intuitively, the problem of finding an optimal allocation boils down to
the problem of deciding, for each unit u, whether τ(u) is above or below the cut-off τK, where τK
is the smallest treatment effect of any unit in an optimal allocation. For the units that have τ(u)
value far from τK, we can determine so by estimating τ(u) to low accuracy. For the units that are
close to the threshold τK, mistakenly selecting one unit for another does not change the value of
the allocation much.
We show that an accuracy level of ρ = Θ(√ϵ) strikes the best balance between having the
lowest possible level of accuracy while not losing too much value in the allocation. For this balance
to hold, we need the number of units around the threshold τK to be reasonable. We formalize this
required notion of “smoothness” through our definition of ρ-regularity, which requires that any
interval of length at least ρ contain at most O(ρM) units, that is, a multiple of what we would
expect under the uniform distribution. Thus, ρ-regularity is a weak measure of closeness to the
uniform distribution. Many natural distribution families, such as Gaussians or Beta distributions,
are ρ-regular for a reasonable constant. The most regular distribution is the uniform distribution
itself. Here, our analysis provides the biggest sample improvements for allocation. We prove
that even in this case CATE estimation remains hard, requiring Ω(M/ϵ2) samples. This formally
proves a quadratic separation between treatment allocation and CATE estimation. In particular,
CATE estimation remains hard even after imposing ρ-regularity.
Empirical evaluation.
We consider data from five real-world randomized controlled trials across
various domains (education, economic development, labor economics, and healthcare, as detailed
in Section 6). For each dataset, we evaluate how many samples are needed to obtain a near-optimal
allocation. To do so, we treat the treatment effects estimated from the full RCT dataset as the
ground truth. We then subsample the dataset to various sample sizes and compute the allocation
value realized by our algorithm. As shown in Figure 2, in all cases we find near-optimal allocations
with fewer samples than our theoretical upper bound predicts. This suggests that real-world
treatment effect distributions meet the assumptions of our theory. As a robustness check, we
replicate the results across different partitions of the populations and for varying budget sizes.

the worst-case of O(M/ϵ2) (red) and even less than our theoretical bound O(M/ϵ) (green).
Discussion and limitations.
There’s an immediate practical takeaway relevant to future policy
decisions about targeting welfare-promoting interventions. The standard sample size calculations
for CATE estimation are excessively pessimistic for the purpose of treatment allocation. Indeed,
we can find nearly optimal allocations from coarse treatment effect estimates. Perhaps counter-
intuitively, an RCT that is severely underpowered for CATE estimation can still yield excellent
allocations. As a rule of thumb, M/ϵ samples suffice for a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation.
While our smoothness requirement is typically met in practice, it may not always hold. We
address this limitation in two ways. First, we expose an exact instance-dependent optimality
condition (Section 4.3) that can be computed from coarse estimates as well. Thus, a policymaker
can certify from few samples that a solution is near-optimal or—if it isn’t—invest in additional
samples. Alternatively, we consider strategies for the policymaker to mitigate cases where there
are too many units around the optimal threshold τK without additional samples. Specifically, we
study the strategies of underspending and overspending on the original budget K in order to
obtain a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation with O(M/ϵ) many samples. We show that, in practice, in the
few cases where a close-to-optimal allocation is not realized, we can find a very close threshold
τK′ at which we do realize it with only O(M/ϵ) many samples.
To summarize, our work strongly separates the sample complexity treatment effect estimation
from that of treatment allocation. The latter requires far fewer samples than the former. This stark
separation has the potential to inform future policy decisions about allocating scarce resources.

Related work
Perdomo et al. [PBHA25] and Shirali et al. [SAH24] inspired our work by showing that effective
resource allocation need not require accurate predictions. These works bring into focus a critical
examination of prediction in resource allocation [BVD+18, Per24, SPA25, FAKP25, MFD25]. Our
results extend this line of work with a fundamental observation: Extremely coarse treatment
effect estimates can still yield near-optimal allocations. Perhaps closest to our work, [SAH24] con-
trast unit-level allocations with individual-level targeting, showing that a measure of inter-unit
inequality makes unit-level allocations competitive with individual-level targeting. In our work,
allocations are always unit-level; we study how accurate unit-level treatment effect estimates have
to be for the purpose of allocation.
Another recent line of work studies different strategies for using RCT data effectively [SW25,
CGRSW24, WW25]. In line with these results, our work provides further evidence that investing
in greater accuracy is not always necessary in order to achieve a more efficient intervention. Unlike
these works, our paper focuses on sample complexity upper bounds for treatment allocation,
rather than on considering alternative strategies for estimating treatment effects. There is a vast
causal inference literature on learning optimal targeting rules that address heterogeneity in the
population [Man04, QM11, KT18, Kal18, AW21]. Much work tackles the case of large M using
machine learning methods [CCD+18, NW21], which is not our focus. There’s also much work
targeting rules subject to budget constraints, e.g., [BD12, LVDL16, LVY19].
Our work also relates to the literature on bandits, specifically to the problem of identifying
good arms [AB10] and the numerous variants of this problem, such as identifying any subset
of a set of good arms [KTAS12, BWV13, ZCL14, CLTL15, AAAK17, CLQ17, JJ18, CK19, RM20].
The intuition behind some of these algorithms is similar to the key idea described in Figure 1.
However, our algorithm is non-adaptive, finding a near-optimal allocation from a single sample;
no repeated estimation or adaptive sampling is necessary. The lower bound for CATE estimation
runs through the bandit literature in various guises, see, e.g., [KCG16, KSJ20].

Notation & Preliminaries
We have a population X divided into a set U of M units. Each unit u ∈U is independent from
the others, and we wish to select K out of the M units to carry out an intervention. We operate in
the setting of a resource-constrained positive intervention: ideally, we would like to treat all units,
but a budget limits the number of units that we can intervene on. In order to decide which units
to select, a typical approach is for the policymaker to estimate the average treatment effect τ(u) in
each unit u, and then choose the K units with the highest τ(u) values. Throughout we assume
bounded treatment effects τ(u) ∈[0, 1], normalized to the unit interval.
Estimating the average treatment effect within a unit—either via an RCT or an observational
design—is the well-established problem of causal inference that is not the subject of this work.
We therefore assume that we can get the average treatment effect τ(u) up to an additive error
ϵ > 0 at the cost of O(1/ϵ2) samples. This assumption hides the challenges of causal inference,
but exposes the sample complexity relevant for our argument.
Definition 1. Call ˆτ a (ϵ, δ)-accurate estimate of τ if | ˆτ −τ| ≤ϵ with probability 1 −δ.

Definition 2 (Estimation oracle). Given a unit u ∈U and parameters ϵ, δ > 0, an estimation oracle O
returns a (ϵ, δ)-accurate estimate ˆτ(u) of τ(u) at the cost of O(ln(2/δ)/ϵ2) samples.
Throughout the paper, we always assume that the estimation oracle O is available to the
algorithm. The sample complexity stated in Definition 2 follows from Hoeffding’s inequality.
Namely, by Hoeffding’s inequality, given that τ(u) ∈[0, 1] for all u, it follows that with probability
at least 1 −δ,
Pr
 ˆτ(u) −τ(u)
 ≥ϵ
 ≤2e−2mϵ2.
Hence, if we want ˆτ(u) to be a (ϵ, δ)-accurate estimate of the true value τ(u), we need to take
m ≥O(ln(2/δ)/ϵ2) many samples from u. The upper bound is tight up to constants except in
special cases. This follows from standard lower bounds for mean estimation in Bernoulli families
[LC73, Was04, Tsy08]. These lower bounds extend to estimating average treatment effects [IR15].
Typically, in the setting of treatment effect estimation, we compute a (ϵ, δ)-accurate estimate for
every unit. We refer to this problem as the FullCATE problem.
Definition 3 (FullCATE problem). Given a population X of individuals divided into a set of M units
U, solving the FullCATE(X , U, ϵ, δ) problem consists of producing M estimates ˆτ such that ˆτ(u) is a
(ϵ, δ)-accurate estimate of τ(u) for each u ∈U.
We can compute the sample complexity of the FullCATE problem if we solve it by calling the
estimation oracle with parameters (ϵ, δ) for each unit u ∈U, making a total of M independent
calls. This upper bound is again tight, in general, up to constant factors when groups are non-
overlapping, since each sample can only contribute to estimating one of the treatment effects.
Formally:
Lemma 2. Having access to an estimation oracle O, we can solve the FullCATE(X , U, ϵ, δ) problem with
a total of NFullCATE = O(M ln(2/δ)/ϵ2) samples from X .
2.1
Allocation versus Estimation
Our goal is to find a near-optimal allocation without incurring the cost of solving FullCATE. This
means selecting the K ≤M units with the highest true treatment effect values τ(u), where K is
determined by the given budget. We think of the treatment as a positive intervention, which is why
we focus on identifying the units with the highest values of τ(u). For an integer K ∈{1, . . . , M},
we denote the K-th largest value of τ(u) among the M possible treatment effect values by τK.
Definition 4 (Value). Given a set U of M units and a budget K ≤M, an allocation function g returns
a set Ug ⊆U of K units. The value of the allocation function over an interval A ⊆[0, 1], denoted VUg(A),
is defined as VUg(A) = ∑u∈Ug|τ(u)∈A τ(u). The (total) value of the allocation function g for budget K is
equal to VUg([0, 1]).
We abbreviate VUg([0, 1]) by VUg if the interval A = [0, 1] can be inferred from the context. The
optimal allocation for a given budget is the one that realizes the highest value.
Definition 5. Given a budget to treat K units, the optimal allocation function is the one that selects the K
values τ(u) that maximize the value ∑u∈U τ(u) over all subsets U of K units. We denote the set of units
chosen by the optimal allocation function by U ∗.
Throughout, we assume that the true treatment effect values τ(u) are unique (otherwise, we
can slightly perturb them), and thus the optimal allocation is unique.

Definition 6 (ALLOC problem). Given a budget K ≤M and parameters ϵ, δ, we say that a set Ug ⊆U
of K units is a (ϵ, δ)-optimal allocation ALLOC∗if
VUg([0,1])
VU∗([0,1]) ≥1 −ϵ with probability at least 1 −δ, where
the probability is taken over the coins of g. Solving the ALLOC(X , U, K, ϵ, δ) problem consists of selecting
a set Ug of K units that is a (1 −ϵ, δ)-optimal allocation.
We usually drop the parameter δ, implying that the guarantee holds with high probability.
Crucially, the value of an allocation is computed with the true τ values rather than with the
estimated ˆτ values. The standard way of solving the ALLOC problem is through the FullCATE
problem.
Lemma 3. Given any budget K ≤M and parameters ϵ, δ, we can solve the ALLOC(X , U, ϵ, δ) problem
with N = O(M ln(2/δ)/ϵ2) samples from X .
Proof. By Lemma 2, we can solve the FullCATE(X , U, ϵ, δ) problem with parameters X , U, ϵ, δ with
O(m ln(2/δ)/ϵ2) samples from X . We use parameters ϵ′ and δ/M, for ϵ′ to be determined in the
proof. This produces M estimates ˆτ such that ˆτ(u) is a (ϵ′, δ/M)-accurate estimate of τ(u) for
each u ∈U. We then define the following allocation function g: select the K units with the highest
estimated values ˆτ(u). This defines the set of units Ug.
By definition of τK, it follows that VU ∗([0, 1]) ≥KτK. In the worst case, all the units that we select
are wrong, and by the ϵ′ accuracy guarantee we have that, in general, VU ∗([0, 1]) −VUg([0, 1]) ≤
2Kϵ′, and equivalently
VUg([0, 1])
VU ∗([0, 1]) ≥1 −
2Kϵ′
VU ∗([0, 1]) ≥1 −2Kϵ′
KτK
= 1 −2ϵ′
τK
.
Thus, if we set ϵ′ ≤τK
2 ϵ when calling the FullCATE problem, and by the union bound, we obtain
a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT allocation function. Hence, we have solved the ALLOC problem, as required.
Equivalently, we obtain a (1 −τKϵ/2, δ)-OPT allocation.
3
Directly targeting units for allocation
Recall, the optimal allocation for a given budget K chooses the K units with the largest treatment
effect value τ(u). It is clear that U ∗= {u | τ(u) ≥τK}:
Claim 3.1. Given a budget K, U ∗= {u | τ(u) ≥τK}.
Proof. By definition of τK, there are exactly K −1 units that have τ(u) value higher than τK, all of
which are included in U. Hence swapping any unit in U ∗with one not in the U ∗would decrease
the value of the allocation, which would contradict the optimality of ALLOC∗.
Hence, solving the allocation problem reduces to solving a threshold problem, where for a
given budget K, the task is to determine whether τ(u) ≥τK or τ(u) < τK for each u ∈U. In
the former case, we decide to intervene on unit u; otherwise we do not. In order to solve this
thresholding problem, we do not need to estimate each of the τ(u) values up to accuracy ϵ; we
only need to determine whether τ(u) lies above or below τK. The farther τ(u) is from τK, the less
accuracy we need for our corresponding ˆτ(u) estimate. Conversely, we only need high accuracy
in estimating ˆτ(u) when τ(u) is close to the threshold τK.

3.1
Low-accuracy estimation algorithm
We introduce another parameter ρ that quantifies the error to which we estimate each treatment
effect. Intuitively, we only try to determine whether τ(u) is above τK + 2ρ or not. If we believe
that τ(u) belongs to the interval [τK, τK + 2ρ], then we “give up” and stop trying to determine the
precise value of τ(u). Hence, we want a value ρ that incurs a low sample complexity, yet a nearly
optimal allocation value.
As we show, the value of ρ that strikes the right balance between a low sample complexity and
a close-to-optimal allocation value is ρ = Θ(√ϵ). That is, instead of estimating all treatment effect
values up to accuracy ϵ, we only estimate them up to accuracy of the order √ϵ and then select the
top K values based on these coarse estimates. This yields the following low-accuracy algorithm
(Algorithm 1), which is non-adaptive so that it can be implemented in a typical one-round RCT
(further sample complexity reductions can be achieved by introducing adaptivity, for example
with a multiple-stage RCT, but these are not usually implementable in practice).
Algorithm 1 Low-estimation non-adaptive allocation (LEA)
Input: M units, budget K, parameters ϵ, δ, γ > 0, where γ = Θ(1).
For each unit u, obtain a (ρ, δ/M)-accurate estimate ˆτ(u) for ρ = γ√ϵ.
Output: A set ULTK consisting of the top K units in sorted order of ˆτ(u) values.
By definition, the algorithm selects all units u such that ˆτ(u) ≥ˆτK. First, by Hoeffding’s bound
and the choice of ρ, the algorithm requires a number of samples proportional to 1/ϵ, rather
than 1/ϵ2.
Lemma 4. Given any X , U, K, Algorithm 1 requires O(M ln(2M/δ)/ϵ) many samples from X .
Proof. By a Hoeffding bound using parameters ρ and δ/M, letting N(u) denote the number of
samples that we require from unit u, we have that
Pr
| ˆτ(u) −τ(u)| ≥ρ
 ≤2 exp(−2N(u) · ρ2) = δ
M =⇒N(u) = ln(2M/δ)
2ρ2
.
Therefore, adding the number of samples across the M units, we obtain that this low-accuracy
estimation requires
M ln(2M/δ)
ρ2
= M ln(2M/δ)
ϵ
many samples from X .
By a union bound, all units u satisfy | ˆτ(u) −τ(u)| ≤ρ with probability at least 1 −δ.
Proof of the near-optimality of the allocation obtained by Algorithm 1.
Lemma 4 establishes
that the LEA algorithm requires O(M/ϵ) many samples. Next, we need to show that, even though
we are estimating each ˆτ(u) value up to accuracy ρ, the allocation is (1 −ϵ)-optimal. We proceed
in a sequence of technical lemmas, which establish the following claims:
1. First, we show that ULTK correctly selects all units such that τ(u) > τK + 2ρ, and correctly
does not select all units such that τ(u) < τK −2ρ (Lemma 5).

2. We are left with the interval of length 4ρ centered around τK, which is delicate to analyze.
We lower-bound the quantity
VULTK([0,1])
VU∗([0,1]) through the quantities ρ, τK, and two more quantities
V(A1) and K0 defined in the proofs (Claim 3.2 and Claim 3.11).
3. In Section 4, we show that when the distribution of treatment effect values is ρ-regular
(which includes the case of the uniform distribution), then the lower bound exhibited in
Claims 3.2 and 3.11 simplifies to 1 −ϵ, thus proving the desired near-optimality of the
allocation.
In Section 3.2 we further develop on how we can compute all of the quantities of interest from
the CDF of the distribution of treatment effect values.
Through a careful analysis of the estimates, we show the following:
Lemma 5. The output estimates ˆτK and the set ULTK returned by Algorithm 1 satisfy the following
properties: (1) | ˆτK −τK| ≤ρ. (2) All units u such that τ(u) > τK + 2ρ belong to ULTK. (3) All units u
such that τ(u) < τK −2ρ do not belong to ULTK.
Proof. We prove each of the three parts separately.
(1) By definition of τK, there are exactly K values τ(u) such that τ(u) ≥τK. By the ρ-accuracy
guarantee on our estimates ˆτ(u), it follows that ˆτ(u) ≥τK −ρ for all such u. Then, there are K
values ˆτ(u) that are at least τK −ρ. By definition of ˆτK, then, it must be that ˆτK ≥τK −ρ.
Symmetrically, ˆτK is definitionally the (M −K + 1)-th smallest number in the increasing
sequence of values ˆτ(u), and similarly τK is the (M −K + 1)-th smallest number in the increasing
sequence of values τ(u). Therefore, exactly M −K values τ(u) are such that τ(u) < τK. By the
ρ-accuracy guarantee, ˆτ(u) < τK + ρ for all such u. Thus there are M −K values ˆτ(u) that are
below τK + ρ. By definition of ˆτK, it must be that ˆτK ≤τK + ρ.
Since ˆτK ≥τK −ρ and ˆτK ≤τK + ρ, it follows that ˆτK ∈[τK −ρ, τK + ρ]. Hence | ˆτK −τK| ≤ρ.
(2) By the ρ-accuracy guarantee, all units u satisfying τ(u) > τK + 2ρ also satisfy ˆτ(u) > τK + ρ.
By part (1) of this claim, it then follows that ˆτ(u) > ˆτK. Hence, Algorithm 1 selects such u for
treatment and so they belong to ULTK.
(3) Symmetrically, by the ρ-accuracy guarantee, all units u satisfying τ(u) < τK −2ρ also satisfy
ˆτ(u) < τK −ρ. By part (1) of this claim, it then follows that ˆτ(u) < ˆτK. Hence, Algorithm 1 does
not select such u for treatment and so they do not belong to ULTK.
In other words, our algorithm selects the units optimally in the intervals (τK + 2ρ, 1] and
[0, τK −2ρ). We only need to worry about the interval surrounding τK. This motivates the
following definitions:
Definition 7. We define the intervals A1 = (τK + 2ρ, 1] and D = [τK, τK + 2ρ]. We also let U 0
LTK =
{c ∈ULTK | τ(u) /∈A1}, K1 = |{u | τ(u) ∈A1}|, and K0 = K −K1.
The guarantees of Lemma 5 imply that VULTK(A1) = VU ∗(A1), and moreover allow us to lower
bound VU 0

with (τK −2ρ)K0, and upper bound VU ∗(D) with (τK + 2ρ)K0. This then allows
us to get the following bound, where we use V(A1) as a short-hand for VULTK(A1) = VU ∗(A1):

Before we prove Claim 3.2, we show some intermediate lemmas.
First, we use interval A1 to analyze the difference between VULTK and VU ∗.
Claim 3.3. VU ∗ [0, 1]
 = VU ∗ [τK, 1]

.
Proof. As shown in Claim 3.1, the optimal allocation for budget K contains all units u such that
τ(u) ≥τK.
Claim 3.4. VULTK

.
Proof. Firstly, VULTK
 [0, 1]
 ≥VULTK(A1) follows since A1 ⊆[0, 1] and V(·) is an additive function.
Secondly, VULTK(A1) = V
 (τK + 2ρ, 1]

follows by the definition of A1.
We can lower bound VULTK
 [0, 1]

more precisely using the interval D = [τK, τK + 2ρ] and the
set U 0
LTK (see Definition 7). Specifically, we write the values of the optimal allocation and our
allocation using the D interval.
Claim 3.5. (1) VU ∗ [0, 1]
 = VU ∗(D) + VU ∗ (τK + 2ρ, 1]

 (τK + 2ρ, 1]

.
Proof. The first equality follows by Claim 3.3 and the additivity of V(·). The second equality
follows just from the additivity of V(·).
We want to separate the budget between the number of units it treats over A1 versus elsewhere,
so we split K as follows:
Definition 8. Let K1 =
{u | τ(u) ∈A1}
, and let K0 = K −K1.
We can now provide the following bounds:
Claim 3.6. VU 0
LTK
 [0, 1]
 ≥(τK −2ρ)K0.
Proof. By Lemma 5, all units u ∈ULTK satisfy τ(u) ≥τK −2ρ, and K0 ≤K.
Claim 3.7. VU ∗(D) ≤(τK + 2ρ)K0.
Proof. By definition of A1, all units u such that τ(u) ∈A1 satisfy τ(u) > τK + 2ρ. Hence, by
definition of K0, any unit u ∈K0 must satisfy τ(u) ≤τK + 2ρ.
Claim 3.8. VULTK

VU ∗(A1) + (τK + 2ρ)K0
.
Proof. The first equality follows from Claim 3.5; the inequality from Claims 3.6, and 3.7.
To further simplify the expression, we use:
10


---

Claim 3.9. VULTK(A1) = VU ∗(A1).
Proof. By definition of A1, all units u ∈A1 satisfy τ(u) > τK + 2ρ. By definition of τK, all such u
are part of U ∗. As for our allocation, by Lemma 5 all such u are also part of ULTK.
By the previous claim, we can use V(A1) as a short-hand for VULTK(A1) = VU ∗(A1). With these
intermediate small claims, we can now show Claim 3.2.
Proof of Claim 3.2. This follows from re-arranging the expression in Claim 3.8. Specifically,
VULTK(A1) + (τK −2ρ)K0
VU ∗(A1) + (τK + 2ρ)K0
= V(A1) + (τK −2ρ)K0
V(A1) + (τK + 2ρ)K0
= V(A1) + (τK + 2ρ)K0 −(τK + 2ρ)K0 + (τK −2ρ)K0
V(A1) + (τK + 2ρ)K0
= 1 −(τK + 2ρ)K0 −(τK −2ρ)K0
V(A1) + (τK + 2ρ)K0
= 1 −
4ρK0
V(A1) + (τK + 2ρ)K0
We let Prτ denote the discrete distribution of τ(u) values. The quantity Prτ[τK, τK + 2ρ] and its
relationship to 2ρM is key to our analysis. To that end, we define the following two quantities:
Definition 9. Let Prτ[τK, τK + 2ρ] = θK and let V(A1) = γ1M.
Moreover, we can relate K0 to the distribution Prτ of treatment effect values:
Claim 3.10. K0 = Prτ
[τK, τK + 2ρ]
 · M.
Proof. All units u selected with the K0 budget satisfy τ(u) /∈A1 by definition, and hence they
satisfy τ(u) ≤τK + 2ρ.
Since all units selected with the K0 budget are still part of U ∗, it
follows that they all satisfy τ(u) ≥τK.
Hence, |K0| =
{u | τ(i) ∈[τK, τK + 2ρ]
.
Lastly,
{u | τ(i) ∈[τK, τK + 2ρ]
 = Prτ[τK, τK + 2ρ] · M by definition of Prτ.
This leads to the following general accuracy bound for Algorithm 1:
Claim 3.11. Given any X , U, K, Algorithm 1 returns a

with O(M ln(2M/δ)/ϵ) many samples.
Proof. Using the Definition 9 on Claim 3.2 and dividing by M it follows that
VULTK


VU ∗ [0, 1]

4ρθK
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK.
This is a (1 −ϵ)-OPT approximation if
4ρθK
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK
≤ϵ.
11


---

Hence, to get a (1 −ϵ)-OPT approximation, we require
θK ≤
ϵγ1
4ρ −ϵ(τK + 2ρ).
Alternatively, by plugging in ρ = γ√ϵ, we obtain the expression in the statement of Claim 3.11.
In Section 4, we show how the expression in Claim 3.11 simplifies to (1 −ϵ) in the case of
ρ-regular distributions, thus attaining a (1 −ϵ)-OPT allocation.
3.2
Quantiles suffice
A key insight in our analysis is the fact that for the problem of treatment allocation we only need
to know quantiles of the distribution. In other words, it’s enough to approximate the CDF of the
distribution Prτ of treatment effect values.
Definition 10. Let F(t) = Prτ[τ(u) ≤t] be the CDF of the distribution of τ(u) values, and let ˆF denote
the CDF corresponding to the distribution Pr ˆτ of the low-accuracy estimates ˆτ(u) produced by Algorithm 1.
That is, ˆF(t) = 1
N|{u : ˆτ(u) ≤t}|.
We denote the PDF by f (t). Given a budget of K ≤M, τK definitionally corresponds to the
value in [0, 1] such that F(τK) = 1 −K/M; i.e., the K-th M-th quantile of the distribution of τ
values. Similarly, γ1 and VU ∗can be computed as permutation-invariant quantities derived from
the CDF:
Claim 3.12. For any budget K ≤M, we can compute τK, γ1, VU ∗as follows: (1) τK = F−1(1 −K/M),
(2) γ1 = 1
N
R 1
τK+2ρ t dF(t), (3) VU ∗([0, 1]) = R 1
τK t dF(t).
Proof. First, τK is definitionally the K-th largest τ(u) value. In terms of the CDF F of treatment
effect values Prτ, this means that τK corresponds to the value in [0, 1] satisfying F(τK) = 1 −K/M.
Second, γ1 definitionally satisfies γ1 = V(A1)/M. By the definition of the value function and
given that A1 = (τK + 2ρ, 1], it follows that
V(A1) =
∑
u|τ(u)∈A1
τ(u).
Therefore, this corresponds to taking the integral R 1
τK+2ρ t f (t) dt, where t accounts for the value of
τ(u) and f (t) for the density of units for each value.
Similarly,
VU ∗([0, 1]) =
Z 1
0 t f (t) dt =
Z 1
τK
t f (t) dt,
given that by Claim 3.3 VU ∗ [0, 1]
 = VU ∗ [τK, 1]

. Lastly, integrating t f (t) dt with the PDF is
equivalent to integrating tdF(t) with the CDF.
Claim 3.12 provides further intuition for why we are able to get optimal treatment allocations
with much coarser estimates: we can permute the units as long as the shape of the CDF is
approximately correct.
12


---

Moreover, the ρ-accurate estimates ˆτ(u) naturally provide an approximation of f and F, which
we can in turn use to check, from the low-accuracy estimates ˆτK, the smoothness behavior of the
treatment effect values around the optimal threshold:
Claim 3.13. For any t ∈[0, 1], ˆF(t −ρ) ≤F(t) ≤ˆF(t + ρ).
Proof. If ˆτ(u) ≤t −ρ, by the ρ-accuracy guarantee it follows that τ(u) ≤ˆτ(u) + ρ ≤t. Hence:
ˆF(t −ρ) = |{u : ˆτ(u) ≤t −ρ}|
M
≤|{u : τ(u) ≤t}|
M
= F(t).
Symmetrically, if τ(u) ≤t, then by the ρ-accuracy guarantee it follows that ˆτ(u) ≤τ(u) + ρ ≤t + ρ.
Hence:
F(t) = |{u : τ(u) ≤t}|
M
≤|{u : ˆτ(u) ≤t + ρ}|
M
= ˆF(t + ρ).
We can equivalently express Claim 3.13 in terms of the number of units present in an interval.
Specifically, for any interval in [0, 1] we have that:
Claim 3.14. Given any interval [a, b] ⊆[0, 1],
u : ˆτ(u) ∈[a + ρ, b −ρ]
 ≤Pr
τ
[a, b]
 · M ≤
u : ˆτ(u) ∈[a −ρ, b + ρ]
.
Proof. By the ρ-accuracy guarantee, we know that for any unit u, if ˆτ(u) ∈[a + ρ, b −ρ], then the
corresponding τ(u) is in [a, b]. Similarly, if τ(u) ∈[a, b], then this implies that ˆτ(u) ∈[a −ρ, b + ρ].
Lastly, the number of τ(u) such that τ(u) ∈[a, b] is precisely equal to Prτ
[a, b]
 · M.
This allows us to use our low-accuracy estimates of the treatment effects to approximate the
true probability mass in any interval by enlarging or shrinking the interval accordingly.
We can use this approximation of the CDF to check the smoothness behavior of the treatment
effect values from our low-accuracy estimates ˆτK. Specifically, we are interested in the number of
units in the D = [τK, τK + 2ρ] interval. By Claim 3.14, we have that
Pr
τ
[τK, τK + 2ρ]
 · M ≤
u : ˆτ(u) ∈[τK −ρ, τK + 3ρ]
.
Moreover, by the ρ-accuracy guarantee, we know that τK ∈[ ˆτK −ρ, ˆτK + ρ]. Hence, the number of
units that have ˆτ(u) value in the interval [ ˆτK −2ρ, ˆτK + 4ρ] upper bounds the quantity
Pr
τ
[τK, τK + 2ρ]
 · M,
and can be entirely computed from our low-accuracy estimates ˆτ. This allows us to check whether
the interval around the optimal threshold contains too many units, and thus fails to satisfy the
smoothness condition required by ρ-regularity. As we discuss in Section 5, we can also use our
low-accuracy estimation of the CDF to guide the choice of the budget, provided there is flexibility
in the choice of the budget.

The Sample Complexity of Treatment Allocation
To illustrate the key ideas, we show that if the treatment effect values τ(u) are uniformly dis-
tributed, our allocation algorithm achieves a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation with O(M/ϵ) many
samples. At the same time, any estimator that computes all M treatment effect values τ(u), each
within ϵ-accuracy, must use at least Ω(M/ϵ2) many samples. Therefore, the uniform distribution
demonstrates a sample complexity gap between the problem of obtaining an optimal allocation
and the problem of full CATE estimation. By uniformly distributed we mean that we place the τ(u)
values uniformly-spaced in [0, 1] and randomly permute them.
Theorem 6. Let the treatment effect values be uniformly distributed. Then: (1) We can obtain a (1 −ϵ, δ)-
approximation of the optimal allocation with N = O(M ln(2M/δ)/ϵ) many samples from X for any
budget K ≤M. (2) FullCATE requires Ω(M/ϵ2) samples.
We show Theorem 6 by first proving a more general result. Namely, we generalize the uniform
distribution to what we call ρ-regular distributions. We then prove Theorem 6 as a corollary from
the more general Theorem 7.
4.1
Smooth distributions
We can generalize our O(M/ϵ) upper bound beyond the uniform distribution. All we require is
for the D-interval to have “uniform-like” mass, so that θK ≈2ρ and thus our proof of Theorem 6
can still go through (i.e., to obtain the ρ2 term in the numerator). Because τK could be anywhere,
we require this condition on all intervals that have width at least 2ρ, a condition that we call
ρ-regularity:
Definition 11. Given ρ > 0, we say that a distribution Z on [0, 1] is ρ-regular if for all intervals S ⊆[0, 1]
such that |S| ≥2ρ there exists a constant c = Θ(1) satisfying PrZ[S] ≤c · U[S], where U = PrU and U
denotes the uniform distribution over [0, 1].
We can view this condition as a form of smoothness requirement. Note that this is a much
looser notion than requiring, for example, O(ρ) total variation distance between Z and U, or
with any other distance measure to the uniform that is not permutation invariant. Note that the
value of c is always upper-bounded by the supremum of the density of the distribution Z; i.e.,
c ≤supt f (t).
Theorem 7. Let the treatment effect values be distributed according to a ρ-regular distribution for
ρ = Θ(√ϵ).
Then, we can obtain a (1 −ϵ, δ)-approximation of the optimal allocation with N =
O(M ln(2M/δ)/ϵ) many samples from X for any budget 0 ≤K ≤M.
Proof. For the first part, we use our Algorithm 1. The sample complexity follows from Claim 4. As
for the accuracy guarantee, by Claim 3.2 we know that we get a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT approximation if
4ρθK
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK
≤ϵ.
(1)
Because Prτ is ρ-regular, we have that
θK = Pr
τ [τK, τK + 2ρ] ≤2ρc
14


---

for some c = Θ(1). As in Section 4, we bound the value of V(A1). We obtain a more conservative
bound by dropping (τK + 2ρ)θK from the denominator and requiring that
4ρ(2ρc)
γ1
= 8cρ2
γ1
≤ϵ.
Hence, we obtain a (1 −ϵ)-OPT approximation by setting γ =
p
γ1/(8c) and ρ = γ√ϵ, which
ensures that the previous inequality holds.
We can also keep the more precise ratio
4ρθK
γ1+(τK+2ρ)θK . Note that
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK ≥VU ∗([τK, 1]) = VU ∗.
We remark that VU ∗is a function of K as well (even if not indicated with a subscript). Therefore,
we need to satisfy the inequality
4ρθK
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK
≤4ρθK
VU ∗≤ϵ,
which we do by setting γ =
p
VU ∗/(8c) and ρ = γ√ϵ.
It is clear from this proof why we need θK ≤2ρc. If we only have the bound θK ≤1, then we
get 4ρ/VU ∗≤ϵ, which in turn requires ρ to be of the order of ϵ, rather than of √ϵ. This would
bring us back to a sample complexity of O(M/ϵ). But if θK ≤2ρc, then we get the term ρ2 in
the numerator, which is the crucial point that allows us to get ρ = Θ(√ϵ) and thus an optimal
allocation algorithm with sample complexity O(M/ϵ) rather than with O(M/ϵ2).
Proof of Theorem 6. For the first part, we use our Algorithm 1. The sample complexity follows
from Claim 4. As for the accuracy guarantee, by Claim 3.2 we know that we get a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT
approximation if
4ρθK
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK
≤ϵ.
(2)
Let ϵ < 1/4 and let M =
 1
2ϵ

. Consider the following family of instances of treatment effects:
F =
n
(τ1, τ2, . . . , τM) : τi = i
M + biϵ, bi ∈{−1, +1} ∀i
o
.
Note that this is a family of 2M instances of treatment effects. Moreover, across the 2M instances,
the order of treatment effect values is preserved, given that 1/M + ϵ < 2/M −ϵ by the definition
of M.
First we show the upper bound. We claim that for every instance in the family F, ALLOC has
sample complexity O(M/ϵ). To prove this, we use Theorem 7 on each instance in F. Specifically,
we claim that each instance in F yields a discrete distribution of M treatment effects that is
ρ-regular with ρ = 1/M and c = 2. This follows from the following argument: let S ⊆[0, 1] be
any interval of length ℓ≥2ρ. By the discrete equal spacing of the treatment effects, there are at
most ℓM + 2 units in S, and so Pr[S] ≤(ℓM + 2)/M = ℓ+ 2/M under this distribution. So for
all intervals S with |S| ≥2ρ = 2/M, it follows that
Pr[S] ≤ℓ+ 2/M ≤2ℓ= 2U[S],
15


---

thus satisfying the definition of ρ-regularity with c = 2. Given that M =
 1
2ϵ

, it follows that
every instance in F is (2ϵ)-regular. Hence, it is also O(√ϵ)-regular, and thus Theorem 7 applies
to each instance in F. It follows that we can obtain a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation with O(M/ϵ)
many samples for each instance in F.
The lower bound follows from the fact that, per the definition of F, it follows that we need
to solve M independent Bernoulli problems. For each such problem, we need to be able to
distinguish between i/M −ϵ and i/M + ϵ, which requires at least O(1/ϵ2) many samples. We
can formalize this argument using a minimax argument based on LeCam’s method. Given a
parameter space Θ, for each θ ∈Θ we let Pθ denote the distribution of the observed data under
parameter θ. Then, LeCam’s Theorem (also known as the two-point method) states that
inf
Ψ sup
θ,θ′ max{Pr
Pθ [Ψ ̸= 0], Pr
Pθ′[Ψ ̸= 1] ≥1
2e−KL(Pθ||Pθ′)
for any estimator Ψ and parameter values θ, θ′ ∈Θ, where PrPθ denotes the probability when the
data is distributed according to Pθ, and similarly for Pθ′ [Yu97]. Here, KL(Pθ||Pθ′) denotes the KL
divergence between Pθ and Pθ′.
In our case, Θ corresponds to the family of instances F. Hence, for each i ∈[1, M], we consider
the two parameters
θ : τi = p −ϵ,
θ′ : τi = p + ϵ,
where p = i/M. If ˆτi is a (ϵ, δ)-accurate estimate of τi, then definitionally it must satisfy
Pr
| ˆτi −(p −ϵ)| ≤ϵ
 ≥1 −δ,
Pr
| ˆτi −(p + ϵ)| ≤ϵ
 ≥1 −δ.
We consider the test Ψu = 1[ ˆτ(u) ≥p]. For a (ϵ, δ)-accurate estimate, we have that
Pr
θ [Ψu = 1] ≤δ,
Pr
θ′ [Ψu = 0] ≤δ.
That is, a good estimator yields a test with small error.
For each i, we observe N samples drawn i.i.d. from Bern(τi). By standard bounds on the KL
divergence we have that
KL(Bern(p −ϵ)||Bern(p + ϵ)) ≤13ϵ2.
Therefore, LeCam’s Theorem tells us that for any estimator Ψ,
Pr
θ [Ψ = 1] + Pr
θ′ [Ψ = 0] ≥1
2e−KL(Bern(p−ϵ)||Bern(p+ϵ).
Hence we get that
2δ ≥1
2e−13Nϵ2 =⇒N ≥
1
13ϵ2 log(1/4δ).
Lastly, by definition of F, it follows that Θ(M) many units have τ(u) value bounded away from
0 and 1. (In the case where we consider p ∈[1/4, 3/4], for example, there are M/2 many such
units.) Therefore, by applying the LeCam Theorem on each such unit and taking a union bound
over them it follows that the total number of samples required for producing (ϵ, δ)-accurate
estimates for all units that have τi value bounded away from 0 and 1 is N = O((M/ϵ2) log(M/δ))
for any estimator Ψ, and hence N = Ω(M/ϵ2), as we wanted to show.
16

While the upper bound of Theorem 6 follows as a corollary of the ρ-regularity theorem
(Theorem 7) for the discrete uniformly-spaced placement of the treatment effect values, it is
illustrative to prove the upper bound for an idealized version of the uniform distribution, where
M →∞.
In this case, we have that
θK = Pr
τ [τK, τK + 2ρ] = 2ρ.
Recall that γ1 is such that V(A1) = γ1M. We can compute V(A1) exactly (as per Claim 3.12),
but for this proof it is enough to bound V(A1). Given that A1 = (τK + 2ρ, 1], it follows that
Prτ[A1] = 1 −(τK + 2ρ) = 1 −τK −2ρ. Hence:
γ1 = V(A1)
M
≥(τK + 2ρ) Pr
τ [A1] = (τK + 2ρ)(1 −τK −2ρ),
given that all units in A1 have value at least τK + 2ρ. Using this bound on the denominator of the
LHS in Equation 2 we get that
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK ≥(τK + 2ρ)(1 −τK −2ρ) + (τK + 2ρ)(2ρ) = (τK + 2ρ)(1 −τK).
Hence by Equation 2 we obtain a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT approximation if
4ρθK
γ1 + (τK + 2ρ)θK
=
4ρ(2ρ)
(τK + 2ρ)(1 −τK) =
8ρ2
(τK + 2ρ)(1 −τK) ≤ϵ.
This is true whenever ρ ≤
r
τK(1 −τK)
8
√ϵ. In the case of the uniform distribution, we have that
τK = 1 −K/M, which allows us to compute the value of γ exactly. We can also provide a general
bound for all budgets K: the function τK(1 −τK) for τK ∈[0, 1] is maximized at 1/4, and so setting
ρ = γ√ϵ for γ =
1
4
√
2 guarantees that our Algorithm 1 achieves a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT approximation.
Note that for any distribution we can get a (1 −ϵ)-OPT approximation by setting γ =
p
γ1/8c
when calling Algorithm 1, by letting c be the minimum value such that PrY[S] ≤c · U[S] for all
intervals S such that |S| ≥2ρ. However, if c is not Θ(1), then ρ might not be of the order Θ(√ϵ),
and so the sample complexity will no longer be of the order O(M/ϵ). That is, for an arbitrary
distribution of τ values Prτ:
Theorem 8. Let c be the minimum value such that Prτ[S] ≤c · U[S] for all subsets S ⊆[0, 1] such
that |S| ≥2ρ. For any budget K ≤M, we call Algorithm 1 with with γ = √
VU ∗/8c. This gives a
(1 −ϵ)-OPT approximation of the optimal allocation with O(M ln(2M/δ)/ρ2) many samples.
We remark that VU ∗is short-hand for VU ∗([0, 1]) and that it is a function of K. If the distribution
is ρ-regular, then c = Θ(1), in which case we require O(M/ϵ) many samples, recovering Theo-
rem 7. Note that solving the FullCATE problem to accuracy ϵ already required having a bound on
τK (Claim 3), if we want to ensure exactly that we get a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation. Similarly, here
we use an upper bound of γ in order to ensure exact ϵ-optimality.
Why ρ-regularity is not a demanding property. As discussed, ρ-regularity is a permutation-invariant
property that only depends on the shape of the CDF. It also ensures that the threshold τK that
determines which units are selected for treatment does not yield a highly arbitrary allocation.

---

Empirically, as we extensively show in our experiments with real-world RCT data in Section 6,
our algorithm highly succeeds in practice, further demonstrating that ρ-regularity is a natural
condition. Moreover, typical families of distributions of treatment effect values are ρ-regular for
reasonable values of γ. As we compute in Section 4.2 using the CDF-derived quantities shown
in Claim 3.12, we can explicitly compute the values of τK, c, VU ∗, and γ for typical distributions
of treatment effect values from their CDF, which we do for the uniform, Beta, and Gaussian
distribution families. In all of these cases, γ ranges between 0.07 and 0.2.
4.2
Examples of γ for typical distributions
For a distribution Prτ, recall that we denote the CDF by F, and so we denote the density function
by f. Note that we can bound the value of γ1 using f:
γ1 =
Z 1
τK+2ρ t f (t) dt =
Z 1
τK
t f (t) dt −

τK

Z 1
τK
t f (t) dt −(τK + 2ρ)θK
≥
Z 1
τK
t f (t) dt −(τK + 2ρ)2cρ.
Recall that R 1
τK t f (t) dt = VK
U ∗. Indeed, in order to compute the value of the optimal allocation, it
suffices to have the CDF function, with any permutation of the units. Similarly, we can compute
τK directly from the CDF. Following our expressions derived in Claim 3.12 and as discussed in
Section 3.2, we can compute the values of γ, c, and VU ∗for various typical distributions from their
CDFs. In these examples, it is neater to integrate t f (t) instead of the CDF directly, but not that we
only need knowledge of the CDF of the distribution (and the integration is equivalent).
Uniform distribution.
For the uniform distribution, we have f (t) = 1. Hence, c = 1, since it is
the maximum possible value of f (t). Moreover, we have:
VU ∗([0, 1]) =
Z 1
τK
t f (t) dt =
Z 1
τK
t dt = 1 −τ2

Moreover, τK = 1 −K/M. Therefore, by Theorem 7 and Claim 8, it follows that
γ =

.
For all K ∈[0, M], γ is maximized at ≈0.35.
Beta distribution.
For α, β, the PDF of the Beta distribution is given by
f (t; α, β) =
1
B(α, β)tα−1(1 −t)β−1,
where the Beta function B(α, β) is the normalization constant, and the CDF is given by
F(t) = B(t; α, β))
B(α, β)
:= Ix(α, β),
18

where B(x; α, β) = R x
0 tα−1(1 −t)β−1 dt is known as the incomplete Beta function.
For α, β > 1, the mode of the distribution is given by

1/2), and so
c ≤sup

Lastly, τK is the value such that F(τK) = 1 −K/M, or equivalently, such that R 1
τK f (t) dt = 1 −K/M.
Given that F(t) = It(α, β), it follows that
τK = I−1
1−α(α, β).
For example, for Beta(2, 2) we have that f (t) = 6t(1 −t) and so supt f (t) = f (1/2) = 1.5. We
also have that It(3, 2) = 4t3 −3t4, and so

it follows that τK corresponds to the unique root of the polynomial 2τ3
K −3τ2

[0, 1]. For example, if K/M = 0.5, we get that VU ∗≈0.34 and γ ≤0.17. For K/M = 0.25 we get
γ ≤0.12, and for K/M = 0.75 we get γ ≤0.19.
For Beta(3, 3) we have that f (t) = 30t2(1 −t)2 and so supt f (t) = f (1/2) = 1.875. We also
have that It(4, 3) = 10t4 −15t5 + 6t6, and so

K −15τ4
K + 10τ3
K −(1 −K/M) = 0 in [0, 1]. For

and for K/M = 0.75 we get γ ≤0.17.
For Beta(2, 4) we have that f (t) = 20t(1 −t)3 and mode

Gaussian distribution.
Given a normal distribution N (µ, σ2), we truncate it to [0, 1] and re-
normalize it. Let ϕ(t) denote the PDF of N (µ, σ2), and Φ(t) the CDF. Let
a = 0 −µ

4.3
General optimality condition
Theorem 7 is not an if and only if statement, and so ρ-regularity is a sufficient but not necessary
condition for Algorithm 1 to obtain a near-optimal allocation. This means that, in some cases, we
can obtain optimal allocations even if there is a lot of mass in the interval around the optimal
threshold τK (e.g., if the units are extremely close to τK). We conclude this section by providing a
necessary and sufficient condition on the CDF of the distribution of τ values (for the worst-case
high probability instance of Algorithm 1), thus providing a precise instance-dependent upper
bound on the sample complexity of near-optimal treatment allocation. To do so, we require the
following definition:
Definition 12. Given budget K ≤M, αK ∈[0, 1] corresponds to the smallest value such that the following
equality holds: Prτ
[τK −2ρ, τK −αK]
 = Prτ
[τK, τK + 2ρ]

.
Claim 4.1. For any budget K ≤M, Algorithm 1 called with parameters ϵ, δ, ρ returns a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT
allocation if and only if the distribution of treatment effect values satisfies:
R τK+2ρ
τK
t f (t) dt −R τK−αK
τK−2ρ t f (t) dt dt ≤ϵ R 1
τK t f (t) .
(3)
Proof. By Claims 3.8 and 3.9, we know that
VULTK
 [0, 1]

VU ∗ [0, 1]
 =
VULTK(A1) + VU 0
LTK
 [0, 1]

VU ∗(A1) + VU ∗(D)
=
V(A1) + VU 0
LTK
V(A1) + VU ∗(D).
By re-arranging the expression in a manner similar to Claim 3.2 (but without using lower and
upper bounds), we get that:
VULTK
 [0, 1]

VU ∗ [0, 1]
 =
V(A1) + VU ∗(D) −VU ∗(D) + VU 0
LTK
V(A1) + VU ∗(D)
= 1 −
VU ∗(D) −VU 0
LTK
V(A1) + VU ∗(D).
By definition of the value function and the PDF f (t), it follows that
V(A1) =
Z 1
τK+2ρ t f (t)dt,
VU ∗(D) =
Z τK+2ρ
τK
t f (t)dt.
As for VU 0
LTK, by Claim 5 it follows that all units u ∈ULTK satisfy τ(u) ≥τK −2ρ. Therefore,
in the worst case, Algorithm 1 selects the K0 units with the lowest τ(u) values in the interval
D = [τK, τK + 2ρ]. This is precisely what the definition of αK captures (Definition 12), and so it
follows that
VU 0
LTK ≥
Z τK−αK
τK−2ρ t f (t)dt,
with the equality holding in the worst-case instance of Algorithm 1 (even with high probability).
Hence, we get a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT allocation whenever
R τK+2ρ
τK
t f (t)dt −R τK−αK
τK−2ρ t f (t)dt
R 1
τK t f (t)dt

as we wanted to show.

We can use our low-accuracy estimates ˆτK to check whether Equation 3 is satisfied (note that
this is only a one-sided guarantee; failing to satisfy it does not imply that the allocation achieved
by Algorithm 1 is not optimal, given that we use various upper bounds).
To do so, we want to compute an upper bound of the expression
VU ∗(D) −VU 0
LTK
VU ∗([0, 1])
(4)
using our ˆτ estimates. To lower bound the denominator, the number of units that have τ(u) ∈
[τK, 1] is lower-bounded by |u : ˆτ(u) ∈[τK + ρ, 1]|. For each of the ˆτ(u) values that we find in this
interval, by ρ-accuracy we know that τ(u) ≥ˆτ(u) −ρ. Hence,
VU ∗([0, 1]) ≥
∑
u: ˆτ(u)≥τK+ρ
ˆτ(u) −ρ.
Because we do not have access to the true τK, but we know that | ˆτK −τK| ≤ρ by Claim 5, we can
actually compute the lower bound as
VU ∗([0, 1]) ≥
∑
u: ˆτ(u)≥ˆτK+2ρ
ˆτ(u) −ρ.
(5)
Next, we upper bound V(D). The number of units that have τ(u) ∈[τK, τK + 2ρ] is upper-bounded
by |u : ˆτ(u) ∈[τK −ρ, τK + 3ρ]|. For each of the ˆτ(u) values that we find in this interval, by
ρ-accuracy we know that τ(u) ≤ˆτ(u) + ρ. Hence,
VU ∗(D) ≤
∑
u: ˆτ(u)∈[τK−ρ,τK+3ρ]
ˆτ(u) + ρ.
Again because we do not have access to the true τK but we do have the guarantee that | ˆτK −τK| ≤ρ,
it follows that
VU ∗(D) ≤
∑
u: ˆτ(u)∈[ ˆτK−2ρ, ˆτK+4ρ]
ˆτ(u) + ρ.
(6)
Lastly, as for VU 0
LTK, we are interested in lower bounding the number of units that belong to U 0
LTK.
To do so, first we lower bound the quantity K0, which corresponds to upper bounding the quantity
K1. We know that K1 ≤|u : ˆτ ∈[τK + ρ, 1]| ≤|u : ˆτ ∈[ ˆτK, 1]|. Hence, K0 ≥K −|u : ˆτ ∈[ ˆτK, 1]|.
Recall that all units in ULTK satisfy τ(u) ≥τK −2ρ. To lower bound the value of VU 0
LTK, we add up
the first K −|u : ˆτ ∈[ ˆτK, 1]| units that have ˆτ(u) value above ˆτK −3ρ, in increasing order.
Putting the three terms together, that is, our bounds for VU ∗([0, 1]) (Equation 5), VU ∗(D)
(Equation 6), and VU 0
LTK (the sum of the first K −|u : ˆτ ∈[ ˆτK, 1]| units that have ˆτ(u) value above
ˆτK −3ρ) computed with our low-approximation ˆτ values, we have obtained an upper bound to
the expression in Equation 4 and thus to Equation 3 in Claim 3.
Hence, if our upper bound is smaller than ϵ, we have a guarantee that Algorithm 1 has returned
a (1 −ϵ, δ)-OPT approximation.
It is clear that, definitionally, we get a (1 −ϵ)-OPT allocation whenever we satisfy the inequality

We give an example of how to apply Claim 4.1 for a specific distribution by repeating the
accuracy and sample complexity calculation for the case where the CATE τ values are uniformly
distributed, this time with a tight accuracy analysis rather than using lower and upper bounds for
VA2(I) and VA2(ALLOC∗), respectively.
Tight accuracy calculation for the uniform distribution. Let the treatment effect values be
distributed as Unif(0, 1). Then, the PDF corresponds to the function f (t) = 1. We compute each
of the three terms in the RHS of Equation 3. Given that the uniform distribution is symmetric
around τK for any value of τK, it follows that αK = 0 for all K.

Flexible Budget
When the original τK threshold lies in an interval with too much probability mass, we can
alternatively slide the budget K up or down slightly into a new budget K′ as to find a new
threshold τK′ that lies in an interval where ρ-regularity holds. In our experiments in Section 6,
we test finding the closest K′ to K that obtains a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation with only O(M/ϵ)
samples, in the few cases where the original K does not give an optimal allocation.
Very dense distributions.
Consider the following “2 spikes” case, where M/2 units have τ(u)
value equal to 1/2 −2ϵ, and the other M/2 units have τ(u) value equal to 1/2 + 2ϵ. This example
is connected to the usual lower-bound that appears in the sample complexity of bandit algorithms
[BWV13, KCG16]. We show that for this 2 spikes case, no budget is able to obtain a (1 −ϵ)-optimal
allocation.

As for the low-accuracy estimation algorithm, given that our ˆτ estimates are computed to ρ = γ√ϵ
accuracy, the value of a random allocation, which we denote by Vrand, upper-bounds the value
realized by Algorithm 1 in the worst case.

with probability at least 1 −δ. Hence, for any budget K, the expected value of a random allocation
never yields a (1 −ϵ, δ)-optimal allocation, and is always short of at least K(3ϵ/2 + 2ϵ2) much
value. Thus, the worst-case of Algorithm 1 fails to satisfy the (1 −ϵ, δ)-optimality requirement as
well.
Nonetheless, we are quite close to achieving the value required by an optimal allocation.
This presents an interesting duality for the problem of allocation: either the distribution of
treatment effect values is ρ-regular, in which case Algorithm 1 returns an optimal allocation, or the
distribution is very dense around the threshold, in which case Algorithm 1 (and even a random
allocation) still does quite well. In order to realize the required value, we can either promise a
(1 −κϵ)-OPT allocation, or we can increase the budget in order to include more units. This type of
overspending/resource augmentation is different from the modification of the budget discussed
at the beginning of this section (which cannot work in this 2 spikes case, as we just showed). Here,
we add more units to our allocation ULTK, but we compete against the original budget K.
For the former, we want to find the smallest κ such that a random allocation realizes a
(1 −κϵ)-OPT allocation. This has value:
(1 −κϵ)VU ∗([0, 1]) = (1 −κϵ)

and so Vrand([0, 1]) ≥(1 −4ϵ)VU ∗([0, 1]), as desired. Performing a similar calculation with the
worst-case scenario of Algorithm 1, we get κ ≥8.

Overspending.
Alternatively, we can take the dual approach and ask what is the smallest budget
K′ > K that allows a random allocation to get at least a (1 −ϵ)-OPT allocation, where optimality
is measured with respect to the original budget K. This is a form of resource augmentation. For
any budget K′ > K, we showed that Vrand([0, 1]) = K′/2. We want a K′ that satisfies
K′
2 ≥(1 −ϵ)VU ∗([0, 1]) = (1 −ϵ) · K ·
1
2 + 2ϵ

.
This means that K′ must satisfy
K′ ≥K + 4ϵK −ϵK −4ϵ2K = K + 3ϵK −4ϵ2K.
Hence, we need K′ ≥K + 3ϵK = K(1 + 3ϵ).
We can apply this overspending idea to a distribution that is not ρ-regular around the initial
budget threshold τK. That is, suppose that the initial budget K is such that the interval [τK −
2ρ, τK + 2ρ] contains a lot of probability mass. What is the minimum number S of extra units that
we need to spend on such that we achieve a (1 −ϵ)-OPT allocation, where optimality is measured
with respect to the original budget K? The extra units that we add to ULTK are naturally added in
descending order of ˆτ value starting at ˆτK, and we denote their added value by VU S
extra. That is, the
final threshold is τK+S. Because we assume that the interval [τK −2ρ, τK + 2ρ] is highly dense, we
lower bound the value ˆτ(u) of all of the extra units that we add by τK −2ρ. Then:

Asymptotically, this means that S is of the order of √ϵK0. As we will see in Section 6, in practice
we only require adding one extra unit in order to realize the value of the optimal allocation.

Choosing an appropriate budget: guidelines for policymakers.
In the cases where the poli-
cymaker has some flexibility over the budget, it is a sensible approach to refine the budget after
running our algorithm. Choosing a budget K such that τK lies in an interval (of width ≈2ρ) of
uniform-like probability mass is desirable for several reasons. First, it ensures that an optimal
allocation is achieved, given that ρ-regularity is satisfied in the D-interval. Second, it ensures
that the allocation is less arbitrary, as it minimizes the number of units that are very close to
the threshold that determines whether or not treatment is given. As shown in Section 4.3, the
low-accuracy estimates ˆτ give an approximation of the CDF curve as well, and so we can upper
bound the probability mass contained in an interval [a, b] by counting the number of units u that
have ˆτ(u) value in the interval [a −ρ, b + ρ]. If the interval is too dense, the policymaker can slide
the budget up or down in order to find a threshold ˆτK that lies in a low-mass interval.
While the 2 spikes case demonstrates that we cannot always hope to find such an interval,
this only occurs in the cases where the CDF satisfies a strong “anti-Lipschitz” condition, where
changing K for a much larger or much smaller K′ induces very little difference between τK and
τK′. However, it is rare to find such densely-packed distributions in real-world RCTs, and it would
be highly arbitrary to decide on an allocation in the case of these distributions. As we will see in
Section 6 in our experiments for real-world data, we can always find a K′ very close to K (even
if we are only willing to underspend) in the few cases where Algorithm 1 does not yield an
optimal allocation. Moreover, as we have show in this section, we can obtain optimal allocations
for distributions with high mass around τK by overspending and adding some extra units to ULTK.
We also test this method in our experiments in Section 6.
Summarizing, if a budget does not work, the policymaker can: (1) detect so correctly by using
the approximation ˆF of the CDF (this is a one-sided test), (2) slide the budget from K to K′ as to
find a smooth interval, or (3) if no interval is ρ-regular, then the distribution Prτ is very dense in
the entire range, in which case Algorithm 1 should obtain a (1 −κϵ)-OPT allocation for a small
value of κ, or, equivalently, we can add a few extra units to ULTK to realize the optimal value.
We test these strategies experimentally and report the results in Section B. We find that, in
practice, we only need to slide the budget by at most 2 units in order to find a K that obtains a
(1 −ϵ)-allocation with O(M/ϵ) many samples. As for the overspending/resource augmentation
strategy, we find that in all cases adding one extra unit (namely, the unit corresponding to ˆτK+1)
suffices to realize a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation.

Experiments with real-world RCTs
We test our allocation algorithm extensively on five different real-world RCT datasets across
different domains, this set of five datasets was recently studied in [SW25]. We describe these in
detail, as well as our concrete experimental set-up, in Section A and Section B in the appendix.
(1) Tennessee’s Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) project dataset [PBBZC+97, ABB+08].
Domain: education. Treatment: small class (≈13–17 students). Control: regular class (≈22–25
students). Outcome: kindergarten cumulative test score.
(2) Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) in India dataset [BDS21]. Domain: economic development.
Treatment: one-time capital grant to ultra-poor households. Control: no grant. Outcome: total
household expenditure.

(3) National Supported Work (NSW) demonstration dataset [LaL86, DW99, DW02]. Domain: labor
economics. Treatment: assignment to the NSW training program. Control: not assigned. Outcome:
annual earnings in 1978.
(4) Acupuncture dataset [VRZ+04]. Domain: healthcare. Treatment: acupuncture for chronic
headaches. Control: usual care. Outcome: headache-severity score one year after randomization.
(Treatment lowers the outcome; sign flipped in figures.)
(5) Postoperative Pain dataset [MC99]. Domain: Healthcare. Treatment: licorice gargle prior to
endotracheal intubation. Control: placebo/standard care. Outcome: throat-pain score 4 hours
post-surgery. (Treatment lowers the outcome; sign flipped in figures.)
For each dataset, we partition the individuals into M groups in different ways using the
covariates (e.g., based on student performance, baseline poverty, age, etc.), ensuring that each
group is somewhat balanced in terms of control vs treatment numbers Each different grouping
method yields a partition U of M units. For each unit u, we define τ(u) to be the average treatment
effect within the unit across the entire dataset. Then, we run our semi-synthetic experiments as
follows: each time we sample from the population, we choose a unit u uniformly at random, and
then receive a sample i.i.d. from the distribution Bern(τ(u)). After taking some fixed number of
samples, this process produces an estimate ˆτ(u) for each u. This semi-synthetic setting allows us
to know the ground-truth of the value realized by the optimal allocation. We repeat the whole
sampling procedure 50 times, in order to obtain confidence bounds. For the plots in Figure 2,
for various fixed sample sizes, we compute the corresponding estimates ˆτ, and then the realized
allocation value for various budgets K ≤M.
For the plots in Figure 3, we repeat the sampling simulation for different fixed values of ϵ
(and in turn repeating each simulation 50 times). For each, we call Algorithm 1 and obtain a set
of units ULTK for each budget K. For all budgets K ∈[1, M], we check whether or not ULTK is a
(1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation, and compute the percentage of budgets (out of a total of M possible
budgets) that fail to be (1 −ϵ)-optimal (top row in Figure 2). For the budgets that fail, we compute
the closest budget K′ that yields a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation (blue line, bottom row in Figure 2),
and the closest budget K′ satisfying K′ ≤K; i.e., if we only consider underspending (orange line,
bottom row in Figure 2). We see that, on average, the failure rate always says below 5%, and
that |K′ −K| is typically 1, even if we are only allowed to underspend (K′ ≤K). We also try the
resource augmentation approach of adding more units, and in all failed budget cases we always
realize a (1 −ϵ)-optimal value by adding just one extra unit.
We provide all the details of the experiments and datasets along with the rest of figures (which
include all of our grouping methods for each dataset, thus replicating Figures 2 and 3 extensively
across all datasets and groupings) in the appendix in Sections A and B.

Experimental details
A.1
RCT data
We test our algorithm on real-world RCT data in order to test its efficacy and study the ρ-regularity
smoothness condition in practice. For robustness, we test our algorithm on data from five different
real-world RCTs, which have been conducted across multiple domains. These datasets have
recently been analyzed in the work of [SW25], and tested for different policies, which is why we
choose these five datasets. We summarize each RCT dataset, following the descriptions given in
[SW25] and in the original papers.
(1) Tennessee’s Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) project dataset [PBBZC+97, ABB+08].
Domain: education. This is a 4-year RCT conducted by the Tennessee State Department of
Education to examine class size effects on student performance. The study involved 11,601
students across 79 schools. Students and teachers were randomly assigned to class types beginning
in kindergarten and followed through grade 3. The original study considered three possible
treatments: small class (≈13–17 students), regular class (≈22–25 students), or regular class
with a full-time aide. Following the analysis performed in [SW25], in order to keep the binary
treatment/control study, treatment corresponds to having been assigned to a small class, whereas
control corresponds to having been assigned to a regular class. The outcome is a cumulative
test-score measure in kindergarten (which should be positively affected by the treatment), which
is a composite outcome from four standardized test scores: reading, math, listening, and word
skills.
We filter out observations with missing test scores, treatment assignments, or school IDs,
leaving a total of 3,712 students. Out of these, 1,989 are control and 1,723 are treated.
(2) Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) in India dataset [BDS21]. Domain: economic development.
This RCT studies the long-term effects of providing large one-time capital grants to low-income
households. The treatment given was a one-time capital grant to ultra-poor households, and the
control was to give no grant. The study measured how family income and overall consumption
evolved over a period of 7 years. The outcome variable that we use in our experiments is the
total household expenditure (which should be positively affected by the treatment). This is the
difference between the endline consumption and the baseline consumption.
After filtering the dataset, we have 864 households, with 410 control and 454 treated.
(3) National Supported Work (NSW) demonstration dataset [LaL86, DW99, DW02]. Domain: labor
economics. This study was carried out to analyze the impact of the National Supported Work
Demonstration, which was a job training program, on the income of the participants in the year
1978. This job-training program targeting disadvantaged workers. The dataset also collected the
participants’ income in the year 1975 as a baseline. The treatment was assignment to the NSW
training program, and the control was no assignment. The outcome variable that we use is the
annual earnings in 1978 (which should be positively affected by the treatment).
After filtering the dataset, we have 722 individuals, out of which 425 are control and 297 are
treatment.
(4) Acupuncture dataset [VRZ+04]. Domain: healthcare. This RCT evaluates the effect of
acupuncture therapy on patients with chronic headache, with assessments at randomization, 3
33


---

months, and 1 year. The treatment is acupuncture for chronic headaches, and control is the usual
care. The outcome variable that we use is the headache-severity score one year after randomization.
Headache severity is measured using a discrete 0-5 Likert scale. Treatment is thus expected to
lower the outcome, which is why we flip the sign in our figures for coherence with the other RCTs.
After filtering the dataset, we have 301 patients, with 140 control and 161 treatment.
(5) Postoperative Pain dataset [MC99]. Domain: Healthcare. This RCT investigates whether
gargling a licorice solution prior to endotracheal intubation reduces postoperative sore throat,
a common side effect of thoracic surgery using double-lumen tubes. Hence, treatment corre-
sponds to receiving licorice gargle prior to endotracheal intubation, and control corresponds to
placebo/standard care. The outcome variable we use is throat-pain score 4 hours post-surgery,
measured on a discrete 0-7 Likert scale. As in the case of the acupuncture dataset, treatment is
expected to lower the outcome, and so we also flip the sign in our figures for coherence with the
other RCTs.
After filtering the dataset, we have 233 patients, with 116 control and 117 treatment.
A.2
Semi-synthetic experiments
Grouping methods.
For each of the five RCT datasets, we create a set of units U by partitioning
the individuals into groups from their covariates. For each dataset, we describe the various
grouping methods that we test in our algorithm. For any grouping strategy, we require at least
3 treated individuals and 3 control individuals, and that the treatment rate is between 15% and
85%, to ensure balance within each unit. We only include the grouping methods that succeeded
in creating a set of units satisfying these requirements, and discarded several other grouping
methods based on the dataset variables.
(1) STAR dataset. We use the following grouping methods:
• School groups. We cluster the students by school ID.
• Performance groups. We group the students based on baseline performance percentiles (test
score averages).
• Causal forest groups. We use random forest regressors to predict treatment effects (one for
control and one for treatment), and then cluster the students based on predicted CATE
values and covariates using K-means clustering. We cluster aiming for different number of
groups (typically 30 and 50). We note that we use the name “causal forest” in the figures
for short, but we are referring to CATE-based grouping obtained via random-forest and
clustering; not through a causal forest estimator.
• Propensity score groups. We perform a stratification based on propensity scores using cross-
validated logistic regression, dividing the propensity score distribution into equal-sized
quantile-based strata (thus grouping students with similar propensity score).
(2) TUP dataset. We use the following grouping methods:
• Baseline poverty groups. We group the households using baseline consumption as a poverty
proxy, clustering them using K-means.
• Demographic groups. We search for various demographic variables (such as “gender”, “edu-
34


---

cation”, “age”) and take their intersections.
• Assets. We identify asset-related variables (such as “land” or “livestock”) and group them
using K-means.
• Causal forest groups. We use random forest regressors to predict treatment effects, and then
cluster the households based on the predicted CATE values and covariates using K-means.
• Propensity score groups. We perform a stratification based on propensity scores using cross-
validated logistic regression.
(3) NSW dataset. We use the following grouping methods:
• Baseline earnings groups. We divide the employed individuals into percentile-based earnings
brackets.
• Age groups. We create a percentile-based stratification of the age distribution.
• Causal forest groups. We use random forest regressors to predict treatment effects, and then
cluster the individuals based on the predicted CATE values and covariates using K-means.
• Propensity score groups. We perform a stratification based on propensity scores using cross-
validated logistic regression.
(4) Acupuncture dataset. We use the following grouping methods.
• Age groups. We create percentile-based age brackets.
• Age-Chronicity interaction groups. We compute a score for each patient combining their age
and their chronicity variables, and then group them into equally-sized groups (in order of
the scores).
• Baseline headache. We group the patients by their initial headache score.
• Chronicity groups. We group the patients by the length of chronic headache history.
• Covariate forest groups. We perform a K-means clustering based on the covariate profiles.
• Multidimensional composite groups. We use the variables age, chronicity, baseline headache
score, and combine them into an average score.
(5) Postoperative dataset. We use the following grouping methods.
• BMI groups. We divide the patients into 30 equal-sized BMI brackets.
• Age groups. We perform a percentile-based stratification on the age variable.
• Demographics. We combine different preoperative patient characteristics.
• Covariate forest. We perform K-means clustering on the patient characteristics.
Note that for the acupuncture and postoperative dataset we have less data than for the other
datasets, which is why the group sizes that we obtain are smaller and thus prone to higher error.
Obtaining the CATE values.
Each grouping method for each dataset yields a partition of the
dataset into a set U of M units. For each unit, we compute τ(u) as follows: we compute the
treated outcome mean (i.e., the mean of the outcome variable among the treated members of
35


---

group u) and the control outcome mean (i.e., the mean of the outcome variable among the control
members of group u). Subtracting the control outcome mean from the treatment outcome mean
yields the treatment effect value for each unit. Lastly, we normalize all of the treatment effect
values across the M units into [0, 1], yielding the final τ(u) values.
Once we have the τ(u) values, which allow us to compute the value of the optimal allocation,
we simulate the sampling as follows. For every drawn sample of the population, we select one
of the units u uniformly at random and draw a sample from the distribution Bern(τ(u)). That
is, each group represents an “arm” with a Bernoulli reward equal to its normalized CATE. In all
experiments, we set the failure probability δ to 0.05.
A.3
First approach: generating Figure 2
For this approach, we do not select a specific value of ϵ. Instead, we try different sample sizes,
from N = 100 to N = 20,000 across different budget constraints. Specifically, we try budgets
K that are 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% of M. For each sample size and each budget, we
sample from the population for that many samples and compute the estimates ˆτ(u) for each of the
M units u. Then, we select the K units with the highest ˆτ estimates. Using the ground-truth values
τ(u), we compute the value of this allocation. We then plot the realized value of the allocation
(y-axis) for each sample size (x-axis), having one plot for each fixed budget and grouping method.
We repeat this sampling process 50 times, obtaining an average value of the allocation for each
sample size and confidence bounds.
In each figure, we also plot the value that we would expect from the worst-case bound of
O(M/ϵ2) and our bound of O(M/ϵ). Specifically, from Lemma 3, we have that the expected value
of the allocation using the worst-case bound is
 
1 −

M ln(2M/δ)

· VU ∗.
From Theorem 7, we obtain that the expected value of the allocation using our theoretic bound
for ρ-regular distributions is
 
1 −M ln(2M/δ)
N
!
· VU ∗.
In Section B, we display these plots for each of the grouping methods for each of the datasets. For
each, we plot the relationship between the normalized allocation value and the sample size for
four choices of a budget.
A.4
Second approach: generating Figure 3
For Figure 3 and its further displays in Section B (the last two plots for each subsection), we carry
out our analysis differently.
Here, we do choose a value of ϵ, which ranges from 0.001 to 0.2. Based on our computation of
the value of γ in Section 4.2 for various distributions, we choose to call Algorithm 1 with γ = 0.5.
This bound is best decided using an informed guess of how the τ values are distributed; if γ is
too high then Algorithm 1 will have a higher error rate. For each value of ϵ, we compute the

---

corresponding number of samples in total that we use to construct our estimates ˆτ using our
theoretical bound of N = M ln(2M/δ)/ϵ. Note that each grouping method yields a fixed number
of units M. Sampling that many units, we obtain the coarse estimates ˆτ(u), and for each possible
budget K ∈{1, . . . , M} we compute the value realized by our allocation (where we compute the
value using the ground-truth estimates τ, but they are selected using the low-accuracy estimates
ˆτ). This yields the value VULTK for each budget K.
Separately, for each possible budget K ∈{1, . . . , M}, we compute the value VU ∗of the optimal
allocation. Then, we check whether or not VULTK/VU ∗≥1 −ϵ, for each value of K and for the
fixed value of ϵ. We compute the rate of failed budgets (i.e., the proportion out of M) that do
not achieve a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation. We repeat this process 50 times for each combination
of K and ϵ, giving us a robust average failure rate with confidence bounds. We do this for every
grouping method and for every RCT dataset. The first row in Figure 3 plots some of these failure
rates. The second-to-last plot in each subsection of Section B shows these plots for all of the
grouping strategies for each RCT dataset. In all cases, we see that the average failure rate is below
5%. This is higher for the acupuncture and postoperative datasets, since we work with fewer
groups in all grouping strategies (because the dataset is smaller). Moreover, we remark that in our
experiments we test all budgets, and we do not discard budgets that are very small (e.g., K = 1).
As per the VU ∗term in Theorem 8, very small values of K increase the failure rate. The looser
choice of γ also increases the failure rate. For all these reasons, the failure rate that we obtain is
higher than what it would be if we discarded small budgets and decreased γ further, or if we had
a higher number M of units.
Second, we test our flexible budget strategies discussed in Section 5. In the cases where a
budget K fails to obtain a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation (recall that we are always using the fewer
O(M/ϵ) many samples to compute the allocation), we find the closest value of K′ such that we
obtain a (1 −ϵ)-optimal allocation, and then we report |K −K′|. We also compute such a |K −K′|
for K′ ≤K; i.e., if we are only willing to underspend. We repeat this process 50 times for each
ϵ, grouping method, and RCT. Some of the results are reported in the second row of Figure 3;
the comprehensive set of plots is in Section B. The last plot of each subsection of Section B shows
these plots for all of the grouping strategies for each RCT dataset. In all cases, including the
subcases where we only underspend, we see that, on average, |K −K′| ≤2.
We also test our overspending idea of adding extra units to our allocation. We test it on each of
the failed budget settings. In all cases, without exception, we find that adding one extra unit (i.e.,
the unit that corresponds to ˆτK+1), realizes an optimal allocation.
The code for this paper can be found at: https://github.com/silviacasac/alloc-vs-cate.
Use of LLMs. We have used LLMs to aid in exploring the five RCTs and their various features,
in order to find sensible grouping strategies for each RCT. After implementing the code for the
base simulation of our algorithm, we used LLMs to help adapt the algorithm to the specifics of
each dataset. Lastly, we have used LLMs to double-check the integrals computed for the Beta and
Gaussian distributions.
